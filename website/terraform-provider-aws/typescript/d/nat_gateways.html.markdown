# Data Source: aws\_nat\_gateways

This resource can be useful for getting back a list of NAT gateway ids to be referenced elsewhere.

## Example Usage

The following returns all NAT gateways in a specified VPC that are marked as available

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const dataAwsNatGatewaysNgws = new aws.dataAwsNatGateways.DataAwsNatGateways(
  this,
  "ngws",
  {
    filter: [
      {
        name: "state",
        values: ["available"],
      },
    ],
    vpcId: "${var.vpc_id}",
  }
);
const dataAwsNatGatewayNgw = new aws.dataAwsNatGateway.DataAwsNatGateway(
  this,
  "ngw",
  {
    id: `\${tolist(${dataAwsNatGatewaysNgws.ids})[count.index]}`,
  }
);
/*In most cases loops should be handled in the programming language context and 
not inside of the Terraform context. If you are looping over something external, e.g. a variable or a file input
you should consider using a for loop. If you are looping over something only known to Terraform, e.g. a result of a data source
you need to keep this like it is.*/
dataAwsNatGatewayNgw.addOverride(
  "count",
  `\${length(${dataAwsNatGatewaysNgws.ids})}`
);

```

## Argument Reference

* `filter` - (Optional) Custom filter block as described below.
* `vpcId` - (Optional) VPC ID that you want to filter from.
* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags, each pair of which must exactly match
  a pair on the desired NAT Gateways.

More complex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks,
which take the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the field to filter by, as defined by
  [the underlying AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeNatGateways.html).
* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field.
  A Nat Gateway will be selected if any one of the given values matches.

## Attributes Reference

* `id` - AWS Region.
* `ids` - List of all the NAT gateway ids found.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

* `read` - (Default `20M`)
