  Get an elastic beanstalk solution stack.
---

# Data Source: aws\_elastic\_beanstalk\_solution\_stack

Use this data source to get the name of a elastic beanstalk solution stack.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.dataAwsElasticBeanstalkSolutionStack.DataAwsElasticBeanstalkSolutionStack(
  this,
  "multi_docker",
  {
    mostRecent: true,
    nameRegex: "^64bit Amazon Linux (.*) Multi-container Docker (.*)$",
  }
);

```

## Argument Reference

*   `mostRecent` - (Optional) If more than one result is returned, use the most
    recent solution stack.

*   `nameRegex` - Regex string to apply to the solution stack list returned
    by AWS. See [Elastic Beanstalk Supported Platforms][beanstalk-platforms] from
    AWS documentation for reference solution stack names.

\~> **NOTE:** If more or less than a single match is returned by the search,
Terraform will fail. Ensure that your search is specific enough to return
a single solution stack, or use `mostRecent` to choose the most recent one.

## Attributes Reference

* `name` - Name of the solution stack.
