# Data Source: aws\_secretsmanager\_secret\_version

Retrieve information about a Secrets Manager secret version, including its secret value. To retrieve secret metadata, see the [`awsSecretsmanagerSecret` data source](/docs/providers/aws/d/secretsmanager_secret.html).

## Example Usage

### Retrieve Current Secret Version

By default, this data sources retrieves information based on the `awscurrent` staging label.

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.dataAwsSecretsmanagerSecretVersion.DataAwsSecretsmanagerSecretVersion(
  this,
  "secret-version",
  {
    secretId: "${data.aws_secretsmanager_secret.example.id}",
  }
);

```

### Retrieve Specific Secret Version

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.dataAwsSecretsmanagerSecretVersion.DataAwsSecretsmanagerSecretVersion(
  this,
  "by-version-stage",
  {
    secretId: "${data.aws_secretsmanager_secret.example.id}",
    versionStage: "example",
  }
);

```

### Handling Key-Value Secret Strings in JSON

Reading key-value pairs from JSON back into a native Terraform map can be accomplished in Terraform 0.12 and later with the [`jsondecode()` function](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functions/jsondecode.html):

```typescript
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
new cdktf.TerraformOutput(this, "example", {
  value:
    '${jsondecode(data.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.example.secret_string)["key1"]}',
});

```

## Argument Reference

* `secretId` - (Required) Specifies the secret containing the version that you want to retrieve. You can specify either the ARN or the friendly name of the secret.
* `versionId` - (Optional) Specifies the unique identifier of the version of the secret that you want to retrieve. Overrides `versionStage`.
* `versionStage` - (Optional) Specifies the secret version that you want to retrieve by the staging label attached to the version. Defaults to `awscurrent`.

## Attributes Reference

* `arn` - ARN of the secret.
* `id` - Unique identifier of this version of the secret.
* `secretString` - Decrypted part of the protected secret information that was originally provided as a string.
* `secretBinary` - Decrypted part of the protected secret information that was originally provided as a binary.
* `versionId` - Unique identifier of this version of the secret.
