## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `arn` - (Optional) CodeStar Connection ARN.
* `name` - (Optional) CodeStar Connection name.

\~> **NOTE:** When both `arn` and `name` are specified, `arn` takes precedence.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `connectionStatus` - CodeStar Connection status. Possible values are `pending`, `available` and `error`.
* `id` - CodeStar Connection ARN.
* `hostArn` - ARN of the host associated with the connection.
* `name` - Name of the CodeStar Connection. The name is unique in the calling AWS account.
* `providerType` - Name of the external provider where your third-party code repository is configured. Possible values are `bitbucket` and `gitHub`. For connections to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance, you must create an [aws\_codestarconnections\_host](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/codestarconnections_host) resource and use `hostArn` instead.
* `tags` - Map of key-value resource tags to associate with the resource.
