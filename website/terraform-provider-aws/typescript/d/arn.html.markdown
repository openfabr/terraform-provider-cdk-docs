# Data Source: aws\_arn

Parses an ARN into its constituent parts.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.dataAwsArn.DataAwsArn(this, "db_instance", {
  arn: "arn:aws:rds:eu-west-1:123456789012:db:mysql-db",
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `arn` - (Required) ARN to parse.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

*   `partition` - Partition that the resource is in.

*   `service` - The [service namespace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#genref-aws-service-namespaces) that identifies the AWS product.

*   `region` - Region the resource resides in.
    Note that the ARNs for some resources do not require a region, so this component might be omitted.

*   `account` - The [ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/acct-identifiers.html) of the AWS account that owns the resource, without the hyphens.

*   `resource` - Content of this part of the ARN varies by service.
    It often includes an indicator of the type of resource—for example, an IAM user or Amazon RDS database —followed by a slash (/) or a colon (:), followed by the resource name itself.
