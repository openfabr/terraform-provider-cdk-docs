# Data Source: aws\_regions

Provides information about AWS Regions. Can be used to filter regions i.e., by Opt-In status or only regions enabled for current account. To get details like endpoint and description of each region the data source can be combined with the [`awsRegion` data source](/docs/providers/aws/d/region.html).

## Example Usage

Enabled AWS Regions:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.dataAwsRegions.DataAwsRegions(this, "current", {});

```

All the regions regardless of the availability

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.dataAwsRegions.DataAwsRegions(this, "current", {
  allRegions: true,
});

```

To see regions that are filtered by `"notOptedIn"`, the `allRegions` argument needs to be set to `true` or no results will be returned.

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.dataAwsRegions.DataAwsRegions(this, "current", {
  allRegions: true,
  filter: [
    {
      name: "opt-in-status",
      values: ["not-opted-in"],
    },
  ],
});

```
