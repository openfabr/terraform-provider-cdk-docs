# Data Source: aws\_lakeformation\_permissions

Get permissions for a principal to access metadata in the Data Catalog and data organized in underlying data storage such as Amazon S3. Permissions are granted to a principal, in a Data Catalog, relative to a Lake Formation resource, which includes the Data Catalog, databases, tables, LF-tags, and LF-tag policies. For more information, see [Security and Access Control to Metadata and Data in Lake Formation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/security-data-access.html).

\~> **NOTE:** This data source deals with explicitly granted permissions. Lake Formation grants implicit permissions to data lake administrators, database creators, and table creators. For more information, see [Implicit Lake Formation Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/implicit-permissions.html).

## Example Usage

### Permissions For A Lake Formation S3 Resource

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.dataAwsLakeformationPermissions.DataAwsLakeformationPermissions(
  this,
  "test",
  {
    dataLocation: {
      arn: "${aws_lakeformation_resource.test.arn}",
    },
    principal: "${aws_iam_role.workflow_role.arn}",
  }
);

```

### Permissions For A Glue Catalog Database

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.dataAwsLakeformationPermissions.DataAwsLakeformationPermissions(
  this,
  "test",
  {
    database: {
      catalogId: "110376042874",
      name: "${aws_glue_catalog_database.test.name}",
    },
    principal: "${aws_iam_role.workflow_role.arn}",
  }
);

```

### Permissions For Tag-Based Access Control

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.dataAwsLakeformationPermissions.DataAwsLakeformationPermissions(
  this,
  "test",
  {
    lfTagPolicy: {
      expression: [
        {
          key: "Team",
          values: ["Sales"],
        },
        {
          key: "Environment",
          values: ["Dev", "Production"],
        },
      ],
      resourceType: "DATABASE",
    },
    principal: "${aws_iam_role.workflow_role.arn}",
  }
);

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `principal` – (Required) Principal to be granted the permissions on the resource. Supported principals are IAM users or IAM roles.

One of the following is required:

* `catalogResource` - Whether the permissions are to be granted for the Data Catalog. Defaults to `false`.
* `dataLocation` - Configuration block for a data location resource. Detailed below.
* `database` - Configuration block for a database resource. Detailed below.
* `lfTag` - (Optional) Configuration block for an LF-tag resource. Detailed below.
* `lfTagPolicy` - (Optional) Configuration block for an LF-tag policy resource. Detailed below.

* `tableWithColumns` - Configuration block for a table with columns resource. Detailed below.

The following arguments are optional:

* `catalogId` – (Optional) Identifier for the Data Catalog. By default, the account ID. The Data Catalog is the persistent metadata store. It contains database definitions, table definitions, and other control information to manage your Lake Formation environment.

### data\_location

The following argument is required:

* `arn` – (Required) ARN that uniquely identifies the data location resource.

The following argument is optional:

### lf\_tag

The following arguments are required:

* `key` – (Required) Key-name for the tag.
* `values` - (Required) List of possible values an attribute can take.

The following argument is optional:

* `catalogId` - (Optional) Identifier for the Data Catalog. By default, it is the account ID of the caller.

### lf\_tag\_policy

The following arguments are required:

* `resourceType` – (Required) Resource type for which the tag policy applies. Valid values are `database` and `table`.
* `expression` - (Required) List of tag conditions that apply to the resource's tag policy. Configuration block for tag conditions that apply to the policy. See [`expression`](#expression) below.

The following argument is optional:

* `catalogId` - (Optional) Identifier for the Data Catalog. By default, it is the account ID of the caller.

#### expression

* `key` – (Required) Key-name of an LF-Tag.
* `values` - (Required) List of possible values of an LF-Tag.

### table

The following argument is required:

* `databaseName` – (Required) Name of the database for the table. Unique to a Data Catalog.

The following arguments are optional:

* `name` - (Optional) Name of the table. At least one of `name` or `wildcard` is required.
* `wildcard` - (Optional) Whether to use a wildcard representing every table under a database. At least one of `name` or `wildcard` is required. Defaults to `false`.

### table\_with\_columns

The following arguments are required:
