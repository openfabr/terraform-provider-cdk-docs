# Resource: awsVpcDhcpOptionsAssociation

Provides a VPC DHCP Options Association resource.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.vpcDhcpOptionsAssociation.VpcDhcpOptionsAssociation(
  this,
  "dns_resolver",
  {
    dhcpOptionsId: "${aws_vpc_dhcp_options.foo.id}",
    vpcId: "${aws_vpc.foo.id}",
  }
);

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `vpcId` - (Required) The ID of the VPC to which we would like to associate a DHCP Options Set.
* `dhcpOptionsId` - (Required) The ID of the DHCP Options Set to associate to the VPC.

## Remarks

* You can only associate one DHCP Options Set to a given VPC ID.
* Removing the DHCP Options Association automatically sets AWS's `default` DHCP Options Set to the VPC.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the DHCP Options Set Association.

## Import

DHCP associations can be imported by providing the VPC ID associated with the options:

```console
$ terraform import aws_vpc_dhcp_options_association.imported vpc-0f001273ec18911b1
```
