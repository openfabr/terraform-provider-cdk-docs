description: |-
  Provides a cache policy for a CloudFront ditribution. When itâ€™s attached to a cache behavior,
  the cache policy determines the values that CloudFront includes in the cache key. These
  values can include HTTP headers, cookies, and URL query strings. CloudFront uses the cache
  key to find an object in its cache that it can return to the viewer. It also determines the
  default, minimum, and maximum time to live (TTL) values that you want objects to stay in the
  CloudFront cache.

new aws.cloudfrontCachePolicy.CloudfrontCachePolicy(this, "example", {
  comment: "test comment",
  defaultTtl: 50,
  maxTtl: 100,
  minTtl: 1,
  name: "example-policy",
  parametersInCacheKeyAndForwardedToOrigin: {
    cookiesConfig: {
      cookieBehavior: "whitelist",
      cookies: {
        items: ["example"],
      },
    },
    headersConfig: {
      headerBehavior: "whitelist",
      headers: {
        items: ["example"],
      },
    },
    queryStringsConfig: {
      queryStringBehavior: "whitelist",
