# Resource: awsDbSecurityGroup

Provides an RDS security group resource. This is only for DB instances in the
EC2-Classic Platform. For instances inside a VPC, use the
[`awsDbInstanceVpcSecurityGroupIds`](/docs/providers/aws/r/db_instance.html#vpc_security_group_ids)
attribute instead.

!> **WARNING:** With the retirement of EC2-Classic the `awsDbSecurityGroup` resource has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Any existing resources can be removed from [Terraform state](https://www.terraform.io/language/state) using the [`terraformStateRm`](https://www.terraform.io/cli/commands/state/rm#command-state-rm) command.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.dbSecurityGroup.DbSecurityGroup(this, "default", {
  ingress: [
    {
      cidr: "10.0.0.0/24",
    },
  ],
  name: "rds_sg",
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the DB security group.
* `description` - (Optional) The description of the DB security group. Defaults to "Managed by Terraform".
* `ingress` - (Required) A list of ingress rules.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

Ingress blocks support the following:

* `cidr` - The CIDR block to accept
* `securityGroupName` - The name of the security group to authorize
* `securityGroupId` - The ID of the security group to authorize
* `securityGroupOwnerId` - The owner Id of the security group provided
  by `securityGroupName`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The db security group ID.
* `arn` - The arn of the DB security group.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

DB Security groups can be imported using the `name`, e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_db_security_group.default aws_rds_sg-1
```
