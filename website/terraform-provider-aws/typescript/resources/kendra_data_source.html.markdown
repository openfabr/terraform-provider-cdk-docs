URLs that don't match the patterns are included in the index. If a URL matches both an inclusion and exclusion pattern, the exclusion pattern takes precedence and the URL file isn't included in the index. Array Members: Minimum number of `0` items. Maximum number of `100` items. Length Constraints: Minimum length of `1`. Maximum length of `150`.
* `urlInclusionPatterns` - (Optional) A list of regular expression patterns to include certain URLs to crawl. URLs that match the patterns are included in the index.
