# Resource: awsImagebuilderComponent

Manages an Image Builder Component.

## Example Usage

### Inline Data Document

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.imagebuilderComponent.ImagebuilderComponent(this, "example", {
  data: '${yamlencode({\n    phases = [{\n      name = "build"\n      steps = [{\n        action = "ExecuteBash"\n        inputs = {\n          commands = ["echo \'hello world\'"]\n        }\n        name      = "example"\n        onFailure = "Continue"\n      }]\n    }]\n    schemaVersion = 1.0\n  })}',
  name: "example",
  platform: "Linux",
  version: "1.0.0",
});

```

### URI Document

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.imagebuilderComponent.ImagebuilderComponent(this, "example", {
  name: "example",
  platform: "Linux",
  uri: "s3://${aws_s3_object.example.bucket}/${aws_s3_object.example.key}",
  version: "1.0.0",
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the component.
* `platform` - (Required) Platform of the component.
* `version` - (Required) Version of the component.

The following attributes are optional:

* `changeDescription` - (Optional) Change description of the component.
* `data` - (Optional) Inline YAML string with data of the component. Exactly one of `data` and `uri` can be specified. Terraform will only perform drift detection of its value when present in a configuration.
* `description` - (Optional) Description of the component.
* `kmsKeyId` - (Optional) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Key Management Service (KMS) Key used to encrypt the component.
* `skipDestroy` - (Optional) Whether to retain the old version when the resource is destroyed or replacement is necessary. Defaults to `false`.
* `supportedOsVersions` - (Optional) Set of Operating Systems (OS) supported by the component.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of resource tags for the component. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
* `uri` - (Optional) S3 URI with data of the component. Exactly one of `data` and `uri` can be specified.

\~> **NOTE:** Updating `data` or `uri` requires specifying a new `version`. This causes replacement of the resource. The `skipDestroy` argument can be used to retain the old version.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - (Required) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the component.
* `dateCreated` - Date the component was created.
* `encrypted` - Encryption status of the component.
* `owner` - Owner of the component.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).
* `type` - Type of the component.

## Import

`awsImagebuilderComponents` resources can be imported by using the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_imagebuilder_component.example arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-east-1:123456789012:component/example/1.0.0/1
```

Certain resource arguments, such as `uri`, cannot be read via the API and imported into Terraform. Terraform will display a difference for these arguments the first run after import if declared in the Terraform configuration for an imported resource.
