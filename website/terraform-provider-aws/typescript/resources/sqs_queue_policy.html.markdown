# Resource: awsSqsQueuePolicy

Allows you to set a policy of an SQS Queue
while referencing ARN of the queue within the policy.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsSqsQueueQ = new aws.sqsQueue.SqsQueue(this, "q", {
  name: "examplequeue",
});
const dataAwsIamPolicyDocumentTest =
  new aws.dataAwsIamPolicyDocument.DataAwsIamPolicyDocument(this, "test", {
    statement: [
      {
        actions: ["sqs:SendMessage"],
        condition: [
          {
            test: "ArnEquals",
            values: ["${aws_sns_topic.example.arn}"],
            variable: "aws:SourceArn",
          },
        ],
        effect: "Allow",
        principals: [
          {
            identifiers: ["*"],
            type: "*",
          },
        ],
        resources: [awsSqsQueueQ.arn],
        sid: "First",
      },
    ],
  });
const awsSqsQueuePolicyTest = new aws.sqsQueuePolicy.SqsQueuePolicy(
  this,
  "test_2",
  {
    policy: dataAwsIamPolicyDocumentTest.json,
    queueUrl: awsSqsQueueQ.id,
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsSqsQueuePolicyTest.overrideLogicalId("test");

```
