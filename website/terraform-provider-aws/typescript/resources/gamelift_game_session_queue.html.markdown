# Resource: awsGameliftGameSessionQueue

Provides an GameLift Game Session Queue resource.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.gameliftGameSessionQueue.GameliftGameSessionQueue(this, "test", {
  destinations: [
    "${aws_gamelift_fleet.us_west_2_fleet.arn}",
    "${aws_gamelift_fleet.eu_central_1_fleet.arn}",
  ],
  name: "example-session-queue",
  notificationTarget: "${aws_sns_topic.game_session_queue_notifications.arn}",
  playerLatencyPolicy: [
    {
      maximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds: 100,
      policyDurationSeconds: 5,
    },
    {
      maximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds: 200,
    },
  ],
  timeoutInSeconds: 60,
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the session queue.
* `timeoutInSeconds` - (Required) Maximum time a game session request can remain in the queue.
* `destinations` - (Optional) List of fleet/alias ARNs used by session queue for placing game sessions.
* `notificationTarget` - (Optional) An SNS topic ARN that is set up to receive game session placement notifications.
* `playerLatencyPolicy` - (Optional) One or more policies used to choose fleet based on player latency. See below.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

### Nested Fields

#### `playerLatencyPolicy`

* `maximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds` - (Required) Maximum latency value that is allowed for any player.
* `policyDurationSeconds` - (Optional) Length of time that the policy is enforced while placing a new game session. Absence of value for this attribute means that the policy is enforced until the queue times out.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - Game Session Queue ARN.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

GameLift Game Session Queues can be imported by their `name`, e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_gamelift_game_session_queue.example example
```
