# Resource: awsEfsMountTarget

Provides an Elastic File System (EFS) mount target.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsVpcFoo = new aws.vpc.Vpc(this, "foo", {
  cidrBlock: "10.0.0.0/16",
});
const awsSubnetAlpha = new aws.subnet.Subnet(this, "alpha", {
  availabilityZone: "us-west-2a",
  cidrBlock: "10.0.1.0/24",
  vpcId: awsVpcFoo.id,
});
const awsEfsMountTargetAlpha = new aws.efsMountTarget.EfsMountTarget(
  this,
  "alpha_2",
  {
    fileSystemId: "${aws_efs_file_system.foo.id}",
    subnetId: awsSubnetAlpha.id,
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsEfsMountTargetAlpha.overrideLogicalId("alpha");

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `fileSystemId` - (Required) The ID of the file system for which the mount target is intended.
* `subnetId` - (Required) The ID of the subnet to add the mount target in.
* `ipAddress` - (Optional) The address (within the address range of the specified subnet) at
  which the file system may be mounted via the mount target.
* `securityGroups` - (Optional) A list of up to 5 VPC security group IDs (that must
  be for the same VPC as subnet specified) in effect for the mount target.

## Attributes Reference

\~> **Note:** The `dnsName` and `mountTargetDnsName` attributes are only useful if the mount target is in a VPC that has
support for DNS hostnames enabled. See [Using DNS with Your VPC](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-dns.html)
and [VPC resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/vpc.html#enable_dns_hostnames) in Terraform for more information.

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the mount target.
* `dnsName` - The DNS name for the EFS file system.
* `mountTargetDnsName` - The DNS name for the given subnet/AZ per [documented convention](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/mounting-fs-mount-cmd-dns-name.html).
* `fileSystemArn` - Amazon Resource Name of the file system.
* `networkInterfaceId` - The ID of the network interface that Amazon EFS created when it created the mount target.
* `availabilityZoneName` - The name of the Availability Zone (AZ) that the mount target resides in.
* `availabilityZoneId` - The unique and consistent identifier of the Availability Zone (AZ) that the mount target resides in.
* `ownerId` - AWS account ID that owns the resource.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

* `create` - (Default `30M`)
* `delete` - (Default `10M`)

## Import

The EFS mount targets can be imported using the `id`, e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_efs_mount_target.alpha fsmt-52a643fb
```
