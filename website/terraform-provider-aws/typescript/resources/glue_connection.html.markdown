# Resource: awsGlueConnection

Provides a Glue Connection resource.

## Example Usage

### Non-VPC Connection

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.glueConnection.GlueConnection(this, "example", {
  connectionProperties: {
    JDBC_CONNECTION_URL: "jdbc:mysql://example.com/exampledatabase",
    PASSWORD: "examplepassword",
    USERNAME: "exampleusername",
  },
  name: "example",
});

```

### Non-VPC Connection with secret manager reference

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const dataAwsSecretmanagerSecretExample =
  new aws.dataAwsSecretmanagerSecret.DataAwsSecretmanagerSecret(
    this,
    "example",
    {
      name: "example-secret",
    }
  );
const awsGlueConnectionExample = new aws.glueConnection.GlueConnection(
  this,
  "example_1",
  {
    connectionProperties: {
      JDBC_CONNECTION_URL: "jdbc:mysql://example.com/exampledatabase",
      SECRET_ID: dataAwsSecretmanagerSecretExample.name,
    },
    name: "example",
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsGlueConnectionExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

### VPC Connection

For more information, see the [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/populate-add-connection.html#connection-JDBC-VPC).

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.glueConnection.GlueConnection(this, "example", {
  connectionProperties: {
    JDBC_CONNECTION_URL:
      "jdbc:mysql://${aws_rds_cluster.example.endpoint}/exampledatabase",
    PASSWORD: "examplepassword",
    USERNAME: "exampleusername",
  },
  name: "example",
  physicalConnectionRequirements: {
    availabilityZone: "${aws_subnet.example.availability_zone}",
    securityGroupIdList: ["${aws_security_group.example.id}"],
    subnetId: "${aws_subnet.example.id}",
  },
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `catalogId` – (Optional) The ID of the Data Catalog in which to create the connection. If none is supplied, the AWS account ID is used by default.
* `connectionProperties` – (Optional) A map of key-value pairs used as parameters for this connection.
* `connectionType` – (Optional) The type of the connection. Supported are: `custom`, `jdbc`, `kafka`, `marketplace`, `mongodb`, and `network`. Defaults to `jbdc`.
* `description` – (Optional) Description of the connection.
* `matchCriteria` – (Optional) A list of criteria that can be used in selecting this connection.
* `name` – (Required) The name of the connection.
* `physicalConnectionRequirements` - (Optional) A map of physical connection requirements, such as VPC and SecurityGroup. Defined below.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

### physicalConnectionRequirements

* `availabilityZone` - (Optional) The availability zone of the connection. This field is redundant and implied by `subnetId`, but is currently an api requirement.
* `securityGroupIdList` - (Optional) The security group ID list used by the connection.
* `subnetId` - (Optional) The subnet ID used by the connection.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - Catalog ID and name of the connection
* `arn` - The ARN of the Glue Connection.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

Glue Connections can be imported using the `catalogId` (AWS account ID if not custom) and `name`, e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_glue_connection.MyConnection 123456789012:MyConnection
```
