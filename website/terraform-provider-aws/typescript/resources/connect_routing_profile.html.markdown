* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Routing Profile.
* `queueConfigs` - (Optional) One or more `queueConfigs` blocks that specify the inbound queues associated with the routing profile. If no queue is added, the agent only can make outbound calls. The `queueConfigs` block is documented below.
* `tags` - (Optional) Tags to apply to the Routing Profile. If configured with a provider
  [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

A `mediaConcurrencies` block supports the following arguments:

* `channel` - (Required) Specifies the channels that agents can handle in the Contact Control Panel (CCP). Valid values are `voice`, `chat`, `task`.
* `concurrency` - (Required) Specifies the number of contacts an agent can have on a channel simultaneously. Valid Range for `voice`: Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of 1. Valid Range for `chat`: Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of 10. Valid Range for `task`: Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of 10.

* `channel` - (Required) Specifies the channels agents can handle in the Contact Control Panel (CCP) for this routing profile. Valid values are `voice`, `chat`, `task`.
* `delay` - (Required) Specifies the delay, in seconds, that a contact should be in the queue before they are routed to an available agent
* `priority` - (Required) Specifies the order in which contacts are to be handled for the queue.
* `queueId` - (Required) Specifies the identifier for the queue.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Routing Profile.
* `id` - The identifier of the hosting Amazon Connect Instance and identifier of the Routing Profile separated by a colon (`:`).
* `queueConfigs` - In addition to the arguments used in the `queueConfigs` argument block, there are additional attributes exported within the `queueConfigs` block. These additional attributes are documented below.
* `routingProfileId` - The identifier for the Routing Profile.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

A `queueConfigs` block supports the following attributes in addition to the arguments defined earlier:

* `queueArn` - ARN for the queue.
* `queueName` - Name for the queue.

## Import

Amazon Connect Routing Profiles can be imported using the `instanceId` and `routingProfileId` separated by a colon (`:`), e.g.,
