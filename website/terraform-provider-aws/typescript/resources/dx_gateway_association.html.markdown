# Resource: awsDxGatewayAssociation

Associates a Direct Connect Gateway with a VGW or transit gateway.

To create a cross-account association, create an [`awsDxGatewayAssociationProposal` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/dx_gateway_association_proposal.html)
in the AWS account that owns the VGW or transit gateway and then accept the proposal in the AWS account that owns the Direct Connect Gateway
by creating an `awsDxGatewayAssociation` resource with the `proposalId` and `associatedGatewayOwnerAccountId` attributes set.

## Example Usage

### VPN Gateway Association

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsDxGatewayExample = new aws.dxGateway.DxGateway(this, "example", {
  amazonSideAsn: "64512",
  name: "example",
});
const awsVpcExample = new aws.vpc.Vpc(this, "example_1", {
  cidrBlock: "10.255.255.0/28",
});
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsVpcExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const awsVpnGatewayExample = new aws.vpnGateway.VpnGateway(this, "example_2", {
  vpcId: awsVpcExample.id,
});
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsVpnGatewayExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const awsDxGatewayAssociationExample =
  new aws.dxGatewayAssociation.DxGatewayAssociation(this, "example_3", {
    associatedGatewayId: awsVpnGatewayExample.id,
    dxGatewayId: awsDxGatewayExample.id,
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsDxGatewayAssociationExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

### Transit Gateway Association

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsDxGatewayExample = new aws.dxGateway.DxGateway(this, "example", {
  amazonSideAsn: "64512",
  name: "example",
});
const awsEc2TransitGatewayExample = new aws.ec2TransitGateway.Ec2TransitGateway(
  this,
  "example_1",
  {}
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsEc2TransitGatewayExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const awsDxGatewayAssociationExample =
  new aws.dxGatewayAssociation.DxGatewayAssociation(this, "example_2", {
    allowedPrefixes: ["10.255.255.0/30", "10.255.255.8/30"],
    associatedGatewayId: awsEc2TransitGatewayExample.id,
    dxGatewayId: awsDxGatewayExample.id,
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsDxGatewayAssociationExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

### Allowed Prefixes

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsDxGatewayExample = new aws.dxGateway.DxGateway(this, "example", {
  amazonSideAsn: "64512",
  name: "example",
});
const awsVpcExample = new aws.vpc.Vpc(this, "example_1", {
  cidrBlock: "10.255.255.0/28",
});
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsVpcExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const awsVpnGatewayExample = new aws.vpnGateway.VpnGateway(this, "example_2", {
  vpcId: awsVpcExample.id,
});
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsVpnGatewayExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const awsDxGatewayAssociationExample =
  new aws.dxGatewayAssociation.DxGatewayAssociation(this, "example_3", {
    allowedPrefixes: ["210.52.109.0/24", "175.45.176.0/22"],
    associatedGatewayId: awsVpnGatewayExample.id,
    dxGatewayId: awsDxGatewayExample.id,
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsDxGatewayAssociationExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

A full example of how to create a VPN Gateway in one AWS account, create a Direct Connect Gateway in a second AWS account, and associate the VPN Gateway with the Direct Connect Gateway via the `awsDxGatewayAssociationProposal` and `awsDxGatewayAssociation` resources can be found in [the `/examples/dxGatewayCrossAccountVgwAssociation` directory within the Github Repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/tree/main/examples/dx-gateway-cross-account-vgw-association).

## Argument Reference

\~> **NOTE:** `dxGatewayId` and `associatedGatewayId` must be specified for single account Direct Connect gateway associations.

The following arguments are supported:

* `dxGatewayId` - (Required) The ID of the Direct Connect gateway.
* `associatedGatewayId` - (Optional) The ID of the VGW or transit gateway with which to associate the Direct Connect gateway.
  Used for single account Direct Connect gateway associations.
* `associatedGatewayOwnerAccountId` - (Optional) The ID of the AWS account that owns the VGW or transit gateway with which to associate the Direct Connect gateway.
  Used for cross-account Direct Connect gateway associations.
* `proposalId` - (Optional) The ID of the Direct Connect gateway association proposal.
  Used for cross-account Direct Connect gateway associations.
* `allowedPrefixes` - (Optional) VPC prefixes (CIDRs) to advertise to the Direct Connect gateway. Defaults to the CIDR block of the VPC associated with the Virtual Gateway. To enable drift detection, must be configured.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Direct Connect gateway association resource.
* `associatedGatewayType` - The type of the associated gateway, `transitGateway` or `virtualPrivateGateway`.
* `dxGatewayAssociationId` - The ID of the Direct Connect gateway association.
* `dxGatewayOwnerAccountId` - The ID of the AWS account that owns the Direct Connect gateway.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

* `create` - (Default `30M`)
* `update` - (Default `30M`)
* `delete` - (Default `30M`)

## Import

Direct Connect gateway associations can be imported using `dxGatewayId` together with `associatedGatewayId`,
e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_dx_gateway_association.example 345508c3-7215-4aef-9832-07c125d5bd0f/vgw-98765432
```
