# Resource: awsEfsFileSystemPolicy

Provides an Elastic File System (EFS) File System Policy resource.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsEfsFileSystemFs = new aws.efsFileSystem.EfsFileSystem(this, "fs", {
  creationToken: "my-product",
});
const dataAwsIamPolicyDocumentPolicy =
  new aws.dataAwsIamPolicyDocument.DataAwsIamPolicyDocument(this, "policy", {
    statement: [
      {
        actions: [
          "elasticfilesystem:ClientMount",
          "elasticfilesystem:ClientWrite",
        ],
        condition: [
          {
            test: "Bool",
            values: ["true"],
            variable: "aws:SecureTransport",
          },
        ],
        effect: "Allow",
        principals: [
          {
            identifiers: ["*"],
            type: "AWS",
          },
        ],
        resources: [awsEfsFileSystemFs.arn],
        sid: "ExampleStatement01",
      },
    ],
  });
const awsEfsFileSystemPolicyPolicy =
  new aws.efsFileSystemPolicy.EfsFileSystemPolicy(this, "policy_2", {
    bypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck: true,
    fileSystemId: awsEfsFileSystemFs.id,
    policy: dataAwsIamPolicyDocumentPolicy.json,
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsEfsFileSystemPolicyPolicy.overrideLogicalId("policy");

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `fileSystemId` - (Required) The ID of the EFS file system.
* `bypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck` - (Optional) A flag to indicate whether to bypass the `awsEfsFileSystemPolicy` lockout safety check. The policy lockout safety check determines whether the policy in the request will prevent the principal making the request will be locked out from making future `putFileSystemPolicy` requests on the file system. Set `bypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck` to `true` only when you intend to prevent the principal that is making the request from making a subsequent `putFileSystemPolicy` request on the file system. The default value is `false`.
* `policy` - (Required) The JSON formatted file system policy for the EFS file system. see [Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/access-control-overview.html#access-control-manage-access-intro-resource-policies) for more info.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID that identifies the file system (e.g., fs-ccfc0d65).

## Import

The EFS file system policies can be imported using the `id`, e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_efs_file_system_policy.foo fs-6fa144c6
```
