# Resource: awsNetworkmanagerCoreNetwork

Provides a core network resource.

\~> **NOTE on Core Networks and Policy Attachments:** For a given core network, this resource's `policyDocument` argument is incompatible with using the [`awsNetworkmanagerCoreNetworkPolicyAttachment` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/networkmanager_core_network_policy_attachment.html). When using this resource's `policyDocument` argument and the `awsNetworkmanagerCoreNetworkPolicyAttachment` resource, both will attempt to manage the core network's policy document and Terraform will show a permanent difference.

## Example Usage

### Basic

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.networkmanagerCoreNetwork.NetworkmanagerCoreNetwork(this, "example", {
  globalNetworkId: "${aws_networkmanager_global_network.example.id}",
});

```

### With description

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.networkmanagerCoreNetwork.NetworkmanagerCoreNetwork(this, "example", {
  description: "example",
  globalNetworkId: "${aws_networkmanager_global_network.example.id}",
});

```

### With tags

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.networkmanagerCoreNetwork.NetworkmanagerCoreNetwork(this, "example", {
  globalNetworkId: "${aws_networkmanager_global_network.example.id}",
  tags: {
    hello: "world",
  },
});

```

### With VPC Attachment (Single Region)

The example below illustrates the scenario where your policy document has static routes pointing to VPC attachments and you want to attach your VPCs to the core network before applying the desired policy document. Set the `createBasePolicy` argument to `true` if your core network does not currently have any `live` policies (e.g. this is the first `terraformApply` with the core network resource), since a `live` policy is required before VPCs can be attached to the core network. Otherwise, if your core network already has a `live` policy, you may exclude the `createBasePolicy` argument.

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsNetworkmanagerGlobalNetworkExample =
  new aws.networkmanagerGlobalNetwork.NetworkmanagerGlobalNetwork(
    this,
    "example",
    {}
  );
const awsNetworkmanagerCoreNetworkExample =
  new aws.networkmanagerCoreNetwork.NetworkmanagerCoreNetwork(
    this,
    "example_1",
    {
      createBasePolicy: true,
      globalNetworkId: awsNetworkmanagerGlobalNetworkExample.id,
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsNetworkmanagerCoreNetworkExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const awsNetworkmanagerVpcAttachmentExample =
  new aws.networkmanagerVpcAttachment.NetworkmanagerVpcAttachment(
    this,
    "example_2",
    {
      coreNetworkId: awsNetworkmanagerCoreNetworkExample.id,
      subnetArns: "${aws_subnet.example[*].arn}",
      vpcArn: "${aws_vpc.example.arn}",
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsNetworkmanagerVpcAttachmentExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const dataAwsNetworkmanagerCoreNetworkPolicyDocumentExample =
  new aws.dataAwsNetworkmanagerCoreNetworkPolicyDocument.DataAwsNetworkmanagerCoreNetworkPolicyDocument(
    this,
    "example_3",
    {
      coreNetworkConfiguration: [
        {
          asnRanges: ["65022-65534"],
          edgeLocations: [
            {
              location: "us-west-2",
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
      segmentActions: [
        {
          action: "create-route",
          destinationCidrBlocks: ["0.0.0.0/0"],
          destinations: [awsNetworkmanagerVpcAttachmentExample.id],
          segment: "segment",
        },
      ],
      segments: [
        {
          name: "segment",
        },
      ],
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
dataAwsNetworkmanagerCoreNetworkPolicyDocumentExample.overrideLogicalId(
  "example"
);
const awsNetworkmanagerCoreNetworkPolicyAttachmentExample =
  new aws.networkmanagerCoreNetworkPolicyAttachment.NetworkmanagerCoreNetworkPolicyAttachment(
    this,
    "example_4",
    {
      coreNetworkId: awsNetworkmanagerCoreNetworkExample.id,
      policyDocument:
        dataAwsNetworkmanagerCoreNetworkPolicyDocumentExample.json,
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsNetworkmanagerCoreNetworkPolicyAttachmentExample.overrideLogicalId(
  "example"
);

```

### With VPC Attachment (Multi-Region)

The example below illustrates the scenario where your policy document has static routes pointing to VPC attachments and you want to attach your VPCs to the core network before applying the desired policy document. Set the `createBasePolicy` argument of the [`awsNetworkmanagerCoreNetwork` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/networkmanager_core_network.html) to `true` if your core network does not currently have any `live` policies (e.g. this is the first `terraformApply` with the core network resource), since a `live` policy is required before VPCs can be attached to the core network. Otherwise, if your core network already has a `live` policy, you may exclude the `createBasePolicy` argument. For multi-region in a core network that does not yet have a `live` policy, pass a list of regions to the `awsNetworkmanagerCoreNetwork` `basePolicyRegions` argument. In the example below, `usWest2` and `usEast1` are specified in the base policy.

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsNetworkmanagerGlobalNetworkExample =
  new aws.networkmanagerGlobalNetwork.NetworkmanagerGlobalNetwork(
    this,
    "example",
    {}
  );
const awsNetworkmanagerCoreNetworkExample =
  new aws.networkmanagerCoreNetwork.NetworkmanagerCoreNetwork(
    this,
    "example_1",
    {
      basePolicyRegions: ["us-west-2", "us-east-1"],
      createBasePolicy: true,
      globalNetworkId: awsNetworkmanagerGlobalNetworkExample.id,
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsNetworkmanagerCoreNetworkExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const awsNetworkmanagerVpcAttachmentExampleUsEast1 =
  new aws.networkmanagerVpcAttachment.NetworkmanagerVpcAttachment(
    this,
    "example_us_east_1",
    {
      coreNetworkId: awsNetworkmanagerCoreNetworkExample.id,
      provider: "alternate",
      subnetArns: "${aws_subnet.example_us_east_1[*].arn}",
      vpcArn: "${aws_vpc.example_us_east_1.arn}",
    }
  );
const awsNetworkmanagerVpcAttachmentExampleUsWest2 =
  new aws.networkmanagerVpcAttachment.NetworkmanagerVpcAttachment(
    this,
    "example_us_west_2",
    {
      coreNetworkId: awsNetworkmanagerCoreNetworkExample.id,
      subnetArns: "${aws_subnet.example_us_west_2[*].arn}",
      vpcArn: "${aws_vpc.example_us_west_2.arn}",
    }
  );
const dataAwsNetworkmanagerCoreNetworkPolicyDocumentExample =
  new aws.dataAwsNetworkmanagerCoreNetworkPolicyDocument.DataAwsNetworkmanagerCoreNetworkPolicyDocument(
    this,
    "example_4",
    {
      coreNetworkConfiguration: [
        {
          asnRanges: ["65022-65534"],
          edgeLocations: [
            {
              location: "us-west-2",
            },
            {
              location: "us-east-1",
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
      segmentActions: [
        {
          action: "create-route",
          destinationCidrBlocks: ["10.0.0.0/16"],
          destinations: [awsNetworkmanagerVpcAttachmentExampleUsWest2.id],
          segment: "segment",
        },
        {
          action: "create-route",
          destinationCidrBlocks: ["10.1.0.0/16"],
          destinations: [awsNetworkmanagerVpcAttachmentExampleUsEast1.id],

      ],
      segments: [
        {

        },
        {
          name: "segment2",
        },
      ],
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
dataAwsNetworkmanagerCoreNetworkPolicyDocumentExample.overrideLogicalId(
  "example"
);
const awsNetworkmanagerCoreNetworkPolicyAttachmentExample =
  new aws.networkmanagerCoreNetworkPolicyAttachment.NetworkmanagerCoreNetworkPolicyAttachment(
    this,

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `description` - (Optional) Description of the Core Network.
* `basePolicyRegion` - (Optional, **Deprecated** use the `basePolicyRegions` argument instead) The base policy created by setting the `createBasePolicy` argument to `true` requires a region to be set in the `edgeLocations`, `location` key. If `basePolicyRegion` is not specified, the region used in the base policy defaults to the region specified in the `provider` block.
* `basePolicyRegions` - (Optional) A list of regions to add to the base policy. The base policy created by setting the `createBasePolicy` argument to `true` requires one or more regions to be set in the `edgeLocations`, `location` key. If `basePolicyRegions` is not specified, the region used in the base policy defaults to the region specified in the `provider` block.
* `createBasePolicy` - (Optional) Specifies whether to create a base policy when a core network is created or updated. A base policy is created and set to `live` to allow attachments to the core network (e.g. VPC Attachments) before applying a policy document provided using the [`awsNetworkmanagerCoreNetworkPolicyAttachment` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/networkmanager_core_network_policy_attachment.html). This base policy is needed if your core network does not have any `live` policies (e.g. a core network resource created without the `policyDocument` argument) and your policy document has static routes pointing to VPC attachments and you want to attach your VPCs to the core network before applying the desired policy document. Valid values are `true` or `false`. Conflicts with `policyDocument`. An example of this Terraform snippet can be found above [for VPC Attachment in a single region](#with-vpc-attachment-single-region) and [for VPC Attachment multi-region](#with-vpc-attachment-multi-region). An example base policy is shown below. This base policy is overridden with the policy that you specify in the [`awsNetworkmanagerCoreNetworkPolicyAttachment` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/networkmanager_core_network_policy_attachment.html).

```json
{
  "version": "2021.12",
  "core-network-configuration": {
    "asn-ranges": [
      "64512-65534"
    ],
    "vpn-ecmp-support": false,
    "edge-locations": [
      {
        "location": "us-east-1"
      }
    ]
  },
  "segments": [
    {
      "name": "segment",
      "description": "base-policy",
      "isolate-attachments": false,
      "require-attachment-acceptance": false
    }
  ]
}
```

* `globalNetworkId` - (Required) The ID of the global network that a core network will be a part of.
* `policyDocument` - (Optional, **Deprecated** use the [`awsNetworkmanagerCoreNetworkPolicyAttachment`](networkmanager_core_network_policy_attachment.html) resource instead) Policy document for creating a core network. Note that updating this argument will result in the new policy document version being set as the `latest` and `live` policy document. Refer to the [Core network policies documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-manager/latest/cloudwan/cloudwan-policy-change-sets.html) for more information. Conflicts with `createBasePolicy`.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value tags for the Core Network. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

* `create` - (Default `30M`)
* `delete` - (Default `30M`)
* `update` - (Default `30M`)

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - Core Network Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
* `createdAt` - Timestamp when a core network was created.
* `edges` - One or more blocks detailing the edges within a core network. [Detailed below](#edges).
* `id` - Core Network ID.
* `segments` - One or more blocks detailing the segments within a core network. [Detailed below](#segments).
* `state` - Current state of a core network.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

### `edges`

The `edges` configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `asn` - ASN of a core network edge.
* `edgeLocation` - Region where a core network edge is located.
* `insideCidrBlocks` - Inside IP addresses used for core network edges.

### `segments`

The `segments` configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `edgeLocations` - Regions where the edges are located.
* `name` - Name of a core network segment.
* `sharedSegments` - Shared segments of a core network.

## Import

`awsNetworkmanagerCoreNetwork` can be imported using the core network ID, e.g.

```console
$ terraform import aws_networkmanager_core_network.example core-network-0d47f6t230mz46dy4
