# Resource: awsEc2CarrierGateway

Manages an EC2 Carrier Gateway. See the AWS [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/Carrier_Gateway.html) for more information.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.ec2CarrierGateway.Ec2CarrierGateway(this, "example", {
  tags: {
    Name: "example-carrier-gateway",
  },
  vpcId: "${aws_vpc.example.id}",
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
* `vpcId` - (Required) The ID of the VPC to associate with the carrier gateway.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - The ARN of the carrier gateway.
* `id` - The ID of the carrier gateway.
* `ownerId` - The AWS account ID of the owner of the carrier gateway.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

`awsEc2CarrierGateway` can be imported using the carrier gateway's ID,
e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_ec2_carrier_gateway.example cgw-12345
```
