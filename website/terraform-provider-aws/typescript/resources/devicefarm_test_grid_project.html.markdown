# Resource: awsDevicefarmTestGridProject

Provides a resource to manage AWS Device Farm Test Grid Projects.

\~> **NOTE:** AWS currently has limited regional support for Device Farm (e.g., `usWest2`). See [AWS Device Farm endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/devicefarm.html) for information on supported regions.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.devicefarmTestGridProject.DevicefarmTestGridProject(this, "example", {
  name: "example",
  vpcConfig: {
    securityGroupIds: "${aws_security_group.example[*].id}",
    subnetIds: "${aws_subnet.example[*].id}",
    vpcId: "${aws_vpc.example.id}",
  },
});

```

## Argument Reference

* `name` - (Required) The name of the Selenium testing project.
* `description` - (Optional) Human-readable description of the project.
* `vpcConfig` - (Required) The VPC security groups and subnets that are attached to a project. See [VPC Config](#vpc-config) below.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

* `vpcId` - (Required) The ID of the Amazon VPC.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name of this Test Grid Project.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).
