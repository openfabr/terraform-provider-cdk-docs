# Resource: awsOamSinkPolicy

Terraform resource for managing an AWS CloudWatch Observability Access Manager Sink Policy.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsOamSinkExample = new aws.oamSink.OamSink(this, "example", {
  name: "ExampleSink",
});
const awsOamSinkPolicyExample = new aws.oamSinkPolicy.OamSinkPolicy(
  this,
  "example_1",
  {
    policy:
      '${jsonencode({\n    Version = "2012-10-17"\n    Statement = [\n      {\n        Action   = ["oam:CreateLink", "oam:UpdateLink"]\n        Effect   = "Allow"\n        Resource = "*"\n        Principal = {\n          "AWS" = ["1111111111111", "222222222222"]\n        }\n        Condition = {\n          "ForAllValues:StringEquals" = {\n            "oam:ResourceTypes" = ["AWS::CloudWatch::Metric", "AWS::Logs::LogGroup"]\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  })}',
    sinkIdentifier: awsOamSinkExample.id,
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsOamSinkPolicyExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `sinkIdentifier` - (Required) ARN of the sink to attach this policy to.
* `policy` - (Required) JSON policy to use. If you are updating an existing policy, the entire existing policy is replaced by what you specify here.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - ARN of the Sink.
* `sinkId` - ID string that AWS generated as part of the sink ARN.

## Timeouts

* `create` - (Default `1M`)
* `update` - (Default `1M`)

## Import

CloudWatch Observability Access Manager Sink Policy can be imported using the `sinkIdentifier`, e.g.,

```console
