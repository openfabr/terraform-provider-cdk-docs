# Resource: awsCodebuildProject

Provides a CodeBuild Project resource. See also the [`awsCodebuildWebhook` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/codebuild_webhook.html), which manages the webhook to the source (e.g., the "rebuild every time a code change is pushed" option in the CodeBuild web console).

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
