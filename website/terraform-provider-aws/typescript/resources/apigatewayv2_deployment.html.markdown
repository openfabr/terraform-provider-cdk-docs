# Resource: awsApigatewayv2Deployment

Manages an Amazon API Gateway Version 2 deployment.
More information can be found in the [Amazon API Gateway Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-websocket-api.html).

\-> **Note:** Creating a deployment for an API requires at least one `awsApigatewayv2Route` resource associated with that API. To avoid race conditions when all resources are being created together, you need to add implicit resource references via the `triggers` argument or explicit resource references using the [resource `dependsOn` meta-argument](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/meta-arguments/depends_on.html).

\-> Enable the [resource `lifecycle` configuration block `createBeforeDestroy` argument](https://www.terraform.io/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle#create_before_destroy) in this resource configuration to properly order redeployments in Terraform.

## Example Usage

### Basic

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsApigatewayv2DeploymentExample =
  new aws.apigatewayv2Deployment.Apigatewayv2Deployment(this, "example", {
    apiId: "${aws_apigatewayv2_api.example.id}",
    description: "Example deployment",
  });
awsApigatewayv2DeploymentExample.addOverride("lifecycle", [
  {
    create_before_destroy: true,
  },
]);

```

### Redeployment Triggers

\-> **NOTE:** This is an optional and Terraform 0.12 (or later) advanced configuration that shows calculating a hash of the API's Terraform resources to determine changes that should trigger a new deployment. This value will change after the first Terraform apply of new resources, triggering an immediate redeployment, however it will stabilize afterwards except for resource changes. The `triggers` map can also be configured in other, more complex ways to fit the environment, avoiding the immediate redeployment issue.

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsApigatewayv2DeploymentExample =
  new aws.apigatewayv2Deployment.Apigatewayv2Deployment(this, "example", {
    apiId: "${aws_apigatewayv2_api.example.id}",
    description: "Example deployment",
    triggers: {
      redeployment:
        '${sha1(join(",", tolist([\n      jsonencode(aws_apigatewayv2_integration.example),\n      jsonencode(aws_apigatewayv2_route.example),\n    ])))}',
    },
  });
awsApigatewayv2DeploymentExample.addOverride("lifecycle", [
  {
    create_before_destroy: true,
  },
]);

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `apiId` - (Required) API identifier.
* `description` - (Optional) Description for the deployment resource. Must be less than or equal to 1024 characters in length.
* `triggers` - (Optional) Map of arbitrary keys and values that, when changed, will trigger a redeployment. To force a redeployment without changing these keys/values, use the [`terraformTaint` command](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/taint.html).

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - Deployment identifier.
* `autoDeployed` - Whether the deployment was automatically released.

## Import

`awsApigatewayv2Deployment` can be imported by using the API identifier and deployment identifier, e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_apigatewayv2_deployment.example aabbccddee/1122334
```

The `triggers` argument cannot be imported.
