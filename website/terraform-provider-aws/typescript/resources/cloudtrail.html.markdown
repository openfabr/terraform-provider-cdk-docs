# Resource: awsCloudtrail

Provides a CloudTrail resource.

\-> **Tip:** For a multi-region trail, this resource must be in the home region of the trail.

\-> **Tip:** For an organization trail, this resource must be in the master account of the organization.

## Example Usage

### Basic

Enable CloudTrail to capture all compatible management events in region.
For capturing events from services like IAM, `includeGlobalServiceEvents` must be enabled.

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsS3BucketFoo = new aws.s3Bucket.S3Bucket(this, "foo", {
  bucket: "tf-test-trail",
  forceDestroy: true,
});
const dataAwsCallerIdentityCurrent =
  new aws.dataAwsCallerIdentity.DataAwsCallerIdentity(this, "current", {});
const dataAwsIamPolicyDocumentFoo =
  new aws.dataAwsIamPolicyDocument.DataAwsIamPolicyDocument(this, "foo_2", {
    statement: [
      {
        actions: ["s3:GetBucketAcl"],
        effect: "Allow",
        principals: [
          {
            identifiers: ["cloudtrail.amazonaws.com"],
            type: "Service",
          },
        ],
        resources: [awsS3BucketFoo.arn],
        sid: "AWSCloudTrailAclCheck",
      },
      {
        actions: ["s3:PutObject"],
        condition: [
          {
            test: "StringEquals",
            values: ["bucket-owner-full-control"],
            variable: "s3:x-amz-acl",
          },
        ],
        effect: "Allow",
        principals: [
          {
            identifiers: ["cloudtrail.amazonaws.com"],
            type: "Service",
          },
        ],
        resources: [
          `\${${awsS3BucketFoo.arn}}/prefix/AWSLogs/\${${dataAwsCallerIdentityCurrent.accountId}}/*`,
        ],
        sid: "AWSCloudTrailWrite",
      },
    ],
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
dataAwsIamPolicyDocumentFoo.overrideLogicalId("foo");
new aws.cloudtrail.Cloudtrail(this, "foobar", {
  includeGlobalServiceEvents: false,
  name: "tf-trail-foobar",
  s3BucketName: awsS3BucketFoo.id,
  s3KeyPrefix: "prefix",
});
const awsS3BucketPolicyFoo = new aws.s3BucketPolicy.S3BucketPolicy(
  this,
  "foo_4",
  {
    bucket: awsS3BucketFoo.id,
    policy: dataAwsIamPolicyDocumentFoo.json,
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsS3BucketPolicyFoo.overrideLogicalId("foo");

```

### Data Event Logging

CloudTrail can log [Data Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html) for certain services such as S3 objects and Lambda function invocations. Additional information about data event configuration can be found in the following links:

* [CloudTrail API DataResource documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_DataResource.html) (for basic event selector).
* [CloudTrail API AdvancedFieldSelector documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_AdvancedFieldSelector.html) (for advanced event selector).

#### Logging All Lambda Function Invocations By Using Basic Event Selectors

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.cloudtrail.Cloudtrail(this, "example", {
  eventSelector: [
    {
      dataResource: [
        {
          type: "AWS::Lambda::Function",
          values: ["arn:aws:lambda"],
        },
      ],
      includeManagementEvents: true,
      readWriteType: "All",
    },
  ],
});

```

#### Logging All S3 Object Events By Using Basic Event Selectors

        {
          type: "AWS::S3::Object",
          values: ["arn:aws:s3"],
        },
      ],
      includeManagementEvents: true,
      readWriteType: "All",
    },
  ],
});

```

#### Sending Events to CloudWatch Logs

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsCloudwatchLogGroupExample =
  new aws.cloudwatchLogGroup.CloudwatchLogGroup(this, "example", {
    name: "Example",
  });
const awsCloudtrailExample = new aws.cloudtrail.Cloudtrail(this, "example_1", {
  cloudWatchLogsGroupArn: `\${${awsCloudwatchLogGroupExample.arn}}:*`,
});
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsCloudtrailExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the trail.
* `s3BucketName` - (Required) Name of the S3 bucket designated for publishing log files.

The following arguments are optional:

* `advancedEventSelector` - (Optional) Specifies an advanced event selector for enabling data event logging. Fields documented below. Conflicts with `eventSelector`.

* `endsWith` (Optional) - A list of values that includes events that match the last few characters of the event record field specified as the value of `field`.
* `equals` (Optional) - A list of values that includes events that match the exact value of the event record field specified as the value of `field`. This is the only valid operator that you can use with the `readOnly`, `eventCategory`, and `resourcesType` fields.
* `notEndsWith` (Optional) - A list of values that excludes events that match the last few characters of the event record field specified as the value of `field`.
* `notEquals` (Optional) - A list of values that excludes events that match the exact value of the event record field specified as the value of `field`.
* `notStartsWith` (Optional) - A list of values that excludes events that match the first few characters of the event record field specified as the value of `field`.
* `startsWith` (Optional) - A list of values that includes events that match the first few characters of the event record field specified as the value of `field`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - ARN of the trail.
* `homeRegion` - Region in which the trail was created.
* `id` - Name of the trail.
* `tagsAll` - Map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

Cloudtrails can be imported using the `name`, e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_cloudtrail.sample my-sample-trail
```
