# Resource: awsGlacierVault

Provides a Glacier Vault Resource. You can refer to the [Glacier Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/working-with-vaults.html) for a full explanation of the Glacier Vault functionality

\~> **NOTE:** When removing a Glacier Vault, the Vault must be empty.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsSnsTopicAwsSnsTopic = new aws.snsTopic.SnsTopic(
  this,
  "aws_sns_topic",
  {
    name: "glacier-sns-topic",
  }
);
const dataAwsIamPolicyDocumentMyArchive =
  new aws.dataAwsIamPolicyDocument.DataAwsIamPolicyDocument(
    this,
    "my_archive",
    {
      statement: [
        {
          actions: ["glacier:InitiateJob", "glacier:GetJobOutput"],
          effect: "Allow",
          principals: [
            {
              identifiers: ["*"],
              type: "*",
            },
          ],
          resources: [
            "arn:aws:glacier:eu-west-1:432981146916:vaults/MyArchive",
          ],
          sid: "add-read-only-perm",
        },
      ],
    }
  );
const awsGlacierVaultMyArchive = new aws.glacierVault.GlacierVault(
  this,
  "my_archive_2",
  {
    accessPolicy: dataAwsIamPolicyDocumentMyArchive.json,
    name: "MyArchive",
    notification: {
      events: ["ArchiveRetrievalCompleted", "InventoryRetrievalCompleted"],
      snsTopic: awsSnsTopicAwsSnsTopic.arn,
    },
    tags: {
      Test: "MyArchive",
    },
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsGlacierVaultMyArchive.overrideLogicalId("my_archive");

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the Vault. Names can be between 1 and 255 characters long and the valid characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '\_' (underscore), '-' (hyphen), and '.' (period).
* `accessPolicy` - (Optional) The policy document. This is a JSON formatted string.
  The heredoc syntax or `file` function is helpful here. Use the [Glacier Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/vault-access-policy.html) for more information on Glacier Vault Policy
* `notification` - (Optional) The notifications for the Vault. Fields documented below.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

**notification** supports the following:

* `events` - (Required) You can configure a vault to publish a notification for `archiveRetrievalCompleted` and `inventoryRetrievalCompleted` events.
* `snsTopic` - (Required) The SNS Topic ARN.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `location` - The URI of the vault that was created.
* `arn` - The ARN of the vault.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

Glacier Vaults can be imported using the `name`, e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_glacier_vault.archive my_archive
```
