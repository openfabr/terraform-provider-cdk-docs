# Resource: awsChimeVoiceConnectorTerminationCredentials

Adds termination SIP credentials for the specified Amazon Chime Voice Connector.

\~> **Note:** Voice Connector Termination Credentials requires a [Voice Connector Termination](/docs/providers/aws/r/chime_voice_connector_termination.html) to be present. Use of `dependsOn` (as shown below) is recommended to avoid race conditions.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsChimeVoiceConnectorDefault =
  new aws.chimeVoiceConnector.ChimeVoiceConnector(this, "default", {
    name: "test",
    requireEncryption: true,
  });
const awsChimeVoiceConnectorTerminationDefault =
  new aws.chimeVoiceConnectorTermination.ChimeVoiceConnectorTermination(
    this,
    "default_1",
    {
      callingRegions: ["US", "CA"],
      cidrAllowList: ["50.35.78.96/31"],
      cpsLimit: 1,
      disabled: true,
      voiceConnectorId: awsChimeVoiceConnectorDefault.id,
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsChimeVoiceConnectorTerminationDefault.overrideLogicalId("default");
const awsChimeVoiceConnectorTerminationCredentialsDefault =
  new aws.chimeVoiceConnectorTerminationCredentials.ChimeVoiceConnectorTerminationCredentials(
    this,
    "default_2",
    {
      credentials: [
        {
          password: "test!",
          username: "test",
        },
      ],
      depends_on: [`\${${awsChimeVoiceConnectorTerminationDefault.fqn}}`],
      voiceConnectorId: awsChimeVoiceConnectorDefault.id,
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsChimeVoiceConnectorTerminationCredentialsDefault.overrideLogicalId(
  "default"
);
