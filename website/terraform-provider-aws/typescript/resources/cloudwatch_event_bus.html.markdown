# Resource: awsCloudwatchEventBus

Provides an EventBridge event bus resource.

\~> **Note:** EventBridge was formerly known as CloudWatch Events. The functionality is identical.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.cloudwatchEventBus.CloudwatchEventBus(this, "messenger", {
  name: "chat-messages",
});

```

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const dataAwsCloudwatchEventSourceExamplepartner =
  new aws.dataAwsCloudwatchEventSource.DataAwsCloudwatchEventSource(
    this,
    "examplepartner",
    {
      namePrefix: "aws.partner/examplepartner.com",
    }
  );
const awsCloudwatchEventBusExamplepartner =
  new aws.cloudwatchEventBus.CloudwatchEventBus(this, "examplepartner_1", {
    eventSourceName: dataAwsCloudwatchEventSourceExamplepartner.name,
    name: dataAwsCloudwatchEventSourceExamplepartner.name,
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsCloudwatchEventBusExamplepartner.overrideLogicalId("examplepartner");

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the new event bus. The names of custom event buses can't contain the / character. To create a partner event bus, ensure the `name` matches the `eventSourceName`.
* `eventSourceName` (Optional) The partner event source that the new event bus will be matched with. Must match `name`.
* `tags` - (Optional)  A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the event bus.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

EventBridge event buses can be imported using the `name` (which can also be a partner event source name), e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_cloudwatch_event_bus.messenger chat-messages
```
