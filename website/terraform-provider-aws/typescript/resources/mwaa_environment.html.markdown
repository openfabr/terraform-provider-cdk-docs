  Creates a MWAA Environment

# Resource: awsMwaaEnvironment

Creates a MWAA Environment resource.

## Example Usage

A MWAA Environment requires an IAM role (`awsIamRole`), two subnets in the private zone (`awsSubnet`) and a versioned S3 bucket (`awsS3Bucket`).

### Basic Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.mwaaEnvironment.MwaaEnvironment(this, "example", {
  dagS3Path: "dags/",
  executionRoleArn: "${aws_iam_role.example.arn}",
  name: "example",
  networkConfiguration: {
    securityGroupIds: ["${aws_security_group.example.id}"],
    subnetIds: "${aws_subnet.private[*].id}",
  },
  sourceBucketArn: "${aws_s3_bucket.example.arn}",
});

```

### Example with Airflow configuration options

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.mwaaEnvironment.MwaaEnvironment(this, "example", {
  airflowConfigurationOptions: {
    "core.default_task_retries": 16,
    "core.parallelism": 1,
  },
  dagS3Path: "dags/",
  executionRoleArn: "${aws_iam_role.example.arn}",
  name: "example",
  networkConfiguration: {
    securityGroupIds: ["${aws_security_group.example.id}"],
    subnetIds: "${aws_subnet.private[*].id}",
  },
  sourceBucketArn: "${aws_s3_bucket.example.arn}",
});

```

### Example with logging configurations

Note that Airflow task logs are enabled by default with the `info` log level.

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.mwaaEnvironment.MwaaEnvironment(this, "example", {
  dagS3Path: "dags/",
  executionRoleArn: "${aws_iam_role.example.arn}",
  loggingConfiguration: {
    dagProcessingLogs: {
      enabled: true,
      logLevel: "DEBUG",
    },
    schedulerLogs: {
      enabled: true,
      logLevel: "INFO",
    },
    taskLogs: {
      enabled: true,
      logLevel: "WARNING",
    },
    webserverLogs: {
      enabled: true,
      logLevel: "ERROR",
    },
    workerLogs: {
      enabled: true,
      logLevel: "CRITICAL",
    },
  },
  name: "example",
  networkConfiguration: {
    securityGroupIds: ["${aws_security_group.example.id}"],
    subnetIds: "${aws_subnet.private[*].id}",
  },
  sourceBucketArn: "${aws_s3_bucket.example.arn}",
});

```

### Example with tags

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.mwaaEnvironment.MwaaEnvironment(this, "example", {
  dagS3Path: "dags/",
  executionRoleArn: "${aws_iam_role.example.arn}",
  name: "example",
  networkConfiguration: {
    securityGroupIds: ["${aws_security_group.example.id}"],
    subnetIds: "${aws_subnet.private[*].id}",
  },
  sourceBucketArn: "${aws_s3_bucket.example.arn}",
  tags: {
    Environment: "production",
    Name: "example",
  },
});

```
