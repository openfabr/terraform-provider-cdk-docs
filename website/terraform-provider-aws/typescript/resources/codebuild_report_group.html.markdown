# Resource: awsCodebuildReportGroup

Provides a CodeBuild Report Groups Resource.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsS3BucketExample = new aws.s3Bucket.S3Bucket(this, "example", {
  bucket: "my-test",
});
const dataAwsCallerIdentityCurrent =
  new aws.dataAwsCallerIdentity.DataAwsCallerIdentity(this, "current", {});
const dataAwsIamPolicyDocumentExample =
  new aws.dataAwsIamPolicyDocument.DataAwsIamPolicyDocument(this, "example_2", {
    statement: [
      {
        actions: ["kms:*"],
        effect: "Allow",
        principals: [
          {
            identifiers: [
              `arn:aws:iam::\${${dataAwsCallerIdentityCurrent.accountId}}:root`,
            ],
            type: "AWS",
          },
        ],
        resources: ["*"],
        sid: "Enable IAM User Permissions",
      },
    ],
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
dataAwsIamPolicyDocumentExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const awsKmsKeyExample = new aws.kmsKey.KmsKey(this, "example_3", {
  deletionWindowInDays: 7,
  description: "my test kms key",
  policy: dataAwsIamPolicyDocumentExample.json,
});
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsKmsKeyExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const awsCodebuildReportGroupExample =
  new aws.codebuildReportGroup.CodebuildReportGroup(this, "example_4", {
    exportConfig: {
      s3Destination: {
        bucket: awsS3BucketExample.id,
        encryptionDisabled: false,
        encryptionKey: awsKmsKeyExample.arn,
        packaging: "NONE",
        path: "/some",
      },
      type: "S3",
    },
    name: "my test report group",
    type: "TEST",
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsCodebuildReportGroupExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of a Report Group.
* `type` - (Required) The type of the Report Group. Valid value are `test` and `CODE_COVERAGE`.
* `exportConfig` - (Required) Information about the destination where the raw data of this Report Group is exported. see [Export Config](#export-config) documented below.
* `deleteReports` - (Optional) If `true`, deletes any reports that belong to a report group before deleting the report group. If `false`, you must delete any reports in the report group before deleting it. Default value is `false`.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value mapping of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

### Export Config

* `type` - (Required) The export configuration type. Valid values are `s3` and `NO_EXPORT`.
* `s3Destination` - (Required) contains information about the S3 bucket where the run of a report is exported. see [S3 Destination](#s3-destination) documented below.

#### S3 Destination

* `bucket`- (Required) The name of the S3 bucket where the raw data of a report are exported.
* `encryptionKey` - (Required) The encryption key for the report's encrypted raw data. The KMS key ARN.
* `encryptionDisabled`- (Optional) A boolean value that specifies if the results of a report are encrypted.
  **Note: the API does not currently allow setting encryption as disabled**
* `packaging` - (Optional) The type of build output artifact to create. Valid values are: `none` (default) and `zip`.
* `path` - (Optional) The path to the exported report's raw data results.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ARN of Report Group.
* `arn` - The ARN of Report Group.
* `created` - The date and time this Report Group was created.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

CodeBuild Report Group can be imported using the CodeBuild Report Group arn, e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_codebuild_report_group.example arn:aws:codebuild:us-west-2:123456789:report-group/report-group-name
```
