## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `capacity` - (Required) Information about the capacity allocated to the connector. See below.
* `connectorConfiguration` - (Required) A map of keys to values that represent the configuration for the connector.
* `description` - (Optional) A summary description of the connector.
* `kafkaCluster` - (Required) Specifies which Apache Kafka cluster to connect to. See below.
* `kafkaClusterClientAuthentication` - (Required) Details of the client authentication used by the Apache Kafka cluster. See below.
* `kafkaClusterEncryptionInTransit` - (Required) Details of encryption in transit to the Apache Kafka cluster. See below.
* `kafkaconnectVersion` - (Required) The version of Kafka Connect. It has to be compatible with both the Apache Kafka cluster's version and the plugins.
* `logDelivery` - (Optional) Details about log delivery. See below.
* `name` - (Required) The name of the connector.
* `plugin` - (Required) Specifies which plugins to use for the connector. See below.
* `serviceExecutionRoleArn` - (Required) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role used by the connector to access the Amazon Web Services resources that it needs. The types of resources depends on the logic of the connector. For example, a connector that has Amazon S3 as a destination must have permissions that allow it to write to the S3 destination bucket.
* `workerConfiguration` - (Optional) Specifies which worker configuration to use with the connector. See below.

### capacity Configuration Block

* `autoscaling` - (Optional) Information about the auto scaling parameters for the connector. See below.
* `provisionedCapacity` - (Optional) Details about a fixed capacity allocated to a connector. See below.

### autoscaling Configuration Block

* `maxWorkerCount` - (Required) The maximum number of workers allocated to the connector.
* `mcuCount` - (Optional) The number of microcontroller units (MCUs) allocated to each connector worker. Valid values: `1`, `2`, `4`, `8`. The default value is `1`.
* `minWorkerCount` - (Required) The minimum number of workers allocated to the connector.
* `scaleInPolicy` - (Optional) The scale-in policy for the connector. See below.
* `scaleOutPolicy` - (Optional) The scale-out policy for the connector. See below.

### scale\_in\_policy Configuration Block

* `cpuUtilizationPercentage` - (Required) Specifies the CPU utilization percentage threshold at which you want connector scale in to be triggered.

### scale\_out\_policy Configuration Block

* `cpuUtilizationPercentage` - (Required) The CPU utilization percentage threshold at which you want connector scale out to be triggered.

### provisioned\_capacity Configuration Block

* `mcuCount` - (Optional) The number of microcontroller units (MCUs) allocated to each connector worker. Valid values: `1`, `2`, `4`, `8`. The default value is `1`.
