## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const dataAwsCallerIdentityCurrent =
  new aws.dataAwsCallerIdentity.DataAwsCallerIdentity(this, "current", {});
const dataAwsRegionCurrent = new aws.dataAwsRegion.DataAwsRegion(
  this,
  "current_1",

/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
dataAwsRegionCurrent.overrideLogicalId("current");
