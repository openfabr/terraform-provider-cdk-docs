# Resource: awsNetworkAclAssociation

Provides an network ACL association resource which allows you to associate your network ACL with any subnet(s).

\~> **NOTE on Network ACLs and Network ACL Associations:** Terraform provides both a standalone network ACL association resource
and a [network ACL](network_acl.html) resource with a `subnetIds` attribute. Do not use the same subnet ID in both a network ACL
resource and a network ACL association resource. Doing so will cause a conflict of associations and will overwrite the association.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.networkAclAssociation.NetworkAclAssociation(this, "main", {
  networkAclId: "${aws_network_acl.main.id}",
  subnetId: "${aws_subnet.main.id}",
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `networkAclId` - (Required) The ID of the network ACL.
* `subnetId` - (Required) The ID of the associated Subnet.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the network ACL association
