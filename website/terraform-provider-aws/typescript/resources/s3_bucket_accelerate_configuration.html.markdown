## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsS3BucketMybucket = new aws.s3Bucket.S3Bucket(this, "mybucket", {
  bucket: "mybucket",
});
new aws.s3BucketAccelerateConfiguration.S3BucketAccelerateConfiguration(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    bucket: awsS3BucketMybucket.id,
    status: "Enabled",
  }
);

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `bucket` - (Required, Forces new resource) Name of the bucket.
* `expectedBucketOwner` - (Optional, Forces new resource) Account ID of the expected bucket owner.
* `status` - (Required) Transfer acceleration state of the bucket. Valid values: `enabled`, `suspended`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The `bucket` or `bucket` and `expectedBucketOwner` separated by a comma (`,`) if the latter is provided.

## Import

S3 bucket accelerate configuration can be imported in one of two ways.

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket is the same account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider,
the S3 bucket accelerate configuration resource should be imported using the `bucket` e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_s3_bucket_accelerate_configuration.example bucket-name
```

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket differs from the account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider,
the S3 bucket accelerate configuration resource should be imported using the `bucket` and `expectedBucketOwner` separated by a comma (`,`) e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_s3_bucket_accelerate_configuration.example bucket-name,123456789012
```
