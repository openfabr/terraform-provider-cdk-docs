# Resource: awsCodedeployApp

Provides a CodeDeploy application to be used as a basis for deployments

## Example Usage

### ECS Application

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.codedeployApp.CodedeployApp(this, "example", {
  computePlatform: "ECS",
  name: "example",
});

```

### Lambda Application

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.codedeployApp.CodedeployApp(this, "example", {
  computePlatform: "Lambda",
  name: "example",
});

```

### Server Application

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.codedeployApp.CodedeployApp(this, "example", {
  computePlatform: "Server",
  name: "example",
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the application.
* `computePlatform` - (Optional) The compute platform can either be `ecs`, `lambda`, or `server`. Default is `server`.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - The ARN of the CodeDeploy application.
* `applicationId` - The application ID.
* `id` - Amazon's assigned ID for the application.
* `name` - The application's name.
* `githubAccountName` - The name for a connection to a GitHub account.
* `linkedToGithub` - Whether the user has authenticated with GitHub for the specified application.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

CodeDeploy Applications can be imported using the `name`, e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_codedeploy_app.example my-application
```
