# Resource: awsIotThingGroupMembership

Adds an IoT Thing to an IoT Thing Group.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.iotThingGroupMembership.IotThingGroupMembership(this, "example", {
  overrideDynamicGroup: true,
  thingGroupName: "example-group",
  thingName: "example-thing",
});

```

## Argument Reference

* `thingName` - (Required) The name of the thing to add to a group.
* `thingGroupName` - (Required) The name of the group to which you are adding a thing.
* `overrideDynamicGroup` - (Optional) Override dynamic thing groups with static thing groups when 10-group limit is reached. If a thing belongs to 10 thing groups, and one or more of those groups are dynamic thing groups, adding a thing to a static group removes the thing from the last dynamic group.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The membership ID.

## Import

IoT Thing Group Membership can be imported using the thing group name and thing name.

```console
$ terraform import aws_iot_thing_group_membership.example thing_group_name/thing_name
```
