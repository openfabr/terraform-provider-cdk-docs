# Resource: awsLakeformationPermissions

Grants permissions to the principal to access metadata in the Data Catalog and data organized in underlying data storage such as Amazon S3. Permissions are granted to a principal, in a Data Catalog, relative to a Lake Formation resource, which includes the Data Catalog, databases, tables, LF-tags, and LF-tag policies. For more information, see [Security and Access Control to Metadata and Data in Lake Formation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/security-data-access.html).

!> **WARNING:** Lake Formation permissions are not in effect by default within AWS. Using this resource will not secure your data and will result in errors if you do not change the security settings for existing resources and the default security settings for new resources. See [Default Behavior and `iamAllowedPrincipals`](#default-behavior-and-iamallowedprincipals) for additional details.

\~> **NOTE:** In general, the `principal` should *NOT* be a Lake Formation administrator or the entity (e.g., IAM role) that is running Terraform. Administrators have implicit permissions. These should be managed by granting or not granting administrator rights using `awsLakeformationDataLakeSettings`, *not* with this resource.

## Default Behavior and `iamAllowedPrincipals`

***Lake Formation permissions are not in effect by default within AWS.*** `iamAllowedPrincipals` (i.e., `IAM_ALLOWED_PRINCIPALS`) conflicts with individual Lake Formation permissions (i.e., non-`iamAllowedPrincipals` permissions), will cause unexpected behavior, and may result in errors.

When using Lake Formation, choose ONE of the following options as they are mutually exclusive:

1. Use this resource (`awsLakeformationPermissions`), change the default security settings using [`awsLakeformationDataLakeSettings`](/docs/providers/aws/r/lakeformation_data_lake_settings.html), and remove existing `iamAllowedPrincipals` permissions
2. Use `iamAllowedPrincipals` without `awsLakeformationPermissions`

This example shows removing the `iamAllowedPrincipals` default security settings and making the caller a Lake Formation admin. Since `createDatabaseDefaultPermissions` and `createTableDefaultPermissions` are not set in the [`awsLakeformationDataLakeSettings`](/docs/providers/aws/r/lakeformation_data_lake_settings.html) resource, they are cleared.

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const dataAwsCallerIdentityCurrent =
  new aws.dataAwsCallerIdentity.DataAwsCallerIdentity(this, "current", {});
const dataAwsIamSessionContextCurrent =
  new aws.dataAwsIamSessionContext.DataAwsIamSessionContext(this, "current_1", {
    arn: dataAwsCallerIdentityCurrent.arn,
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
dataAwsIamSessionContextCurrent.overrideLogicalId("current");
new aws.lakeformationDataLakeSettings.LakeformationDataLakeSettings(
  this,
  "test",
  {
    admins: [dataAwsIamSessionContextCurrent.issuerArn],
  }
);

```

To remove existing `iamAllowedPrincipals` permissions, use the [AWS Lake Formation Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lakeformation/) or [AWS CLI](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/lakeformation/batch-revoke-permissions.html).

`iamAllowedPrincipals` is a hook to maintain backwards compatibility with AWS Glue. `iamAllowedPrincipals` is a pseudo-entity group that acts like a Lake Formation principal. The group includes any IAM users and roles that are allowed access to your Data Catalog resources by your IAM policies.

This is Lake Formation's default behavior:

* Lake Formation grants `super` permission to `iamAllowedPrincipals` on all existing AWS Glue Data Catalog resources.
* Lake Formation enables "Use only IAM access control" for new Data Catalog resources.

For more details, see [Changing the Default Security Settings for Your Data Lake](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/change-settings.html).

### Problem Using `iamAllowedPrincipals`

AWS does not support combining `iamAllowedPrincipals` permissions and non-`iamAllowedPrincipals` permissions. Doing so results in unexpected permissions and behaviors. For example, this configuration grants a user `select` on a column in a table.

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.glueCatalogDatabase.GlueCatalogDatabase(this, "example", {
  name: "sadabate",
});
const awsGlueCatalogTableExample = new aws.glueCatalogTable.GlueCatalogTable(
  this,
  "example_1",
  {
    databaseName: "${aws_glue_catalog_database.test.name}",
    name: "abelt",
    storageDescriptor: {
      columns: [
        {
          name: "event",
          type: "string",
        },
      ],
    },
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsGlueCatalogTableExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const awsLakeformationPermissionsExample =
  new aws.lakeformationPermissions.LakeformationPermissions(this, "example_2", {
    permissions: ["SELECT"],
    principal: "arn:aws:iam:us-east-1:123456789012:user/SanHolo",
    tableWithColumns: {
      columnNames: ["event"],
      databaseName: awsGlueCatalogTableExample.databaseName,
      name: awsGlueCatalogTableExample.name,
    },
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsLakeformationPermissionsExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

The resulting permissions depend on whether the table had `iamAllowedPrincipals` (IAP) permissions or not.

| Result With IAP | Result Without IAP |
| ---- | ---- |
| `select` column wildcard (i.e., all columns) | `select` on `"event"` (as expected) |

## Using Lake Formation Permissions

Lake Formation grants implicit permissions to data lake administrators, database creators, and table creators. These implicit permissions cannot be revoked *per se*. If this resource reads implicit permissions, it will attempt to revoke them, which causes an error when the resource is destroyed.

There are two ways to avoid these errors. First, and the way we recommend, is to avoid using this resource with principals that have implicit permissions. A second, error-prone option, is to grant explicit permissions (and `permissionsWithGrantOption`) to "overwrite" a principal's implicit permissions, which you can then revoke with this resource. For more information, see [Implicit Lake Formation Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/implicit-permissions.html).

If the `principal` is also a data lake administrator, AWS grants implicit permissions that can cause errors using this resource. For example, AWS implicitly grants a `principal`/administrator `permissions` and `permissionsWithGrantOption` of `all`, `alter`, `delete`, `describe`, `drop`, `insert`, and `select` on a table. If you use this resource to explicitly grant the `principal`/administrator `permissions` but *not* `permissionsWithGrantOption` of `all`, `alter`, `delete`, `describe`, `drop`, `insert`, and `select` on the table, this resource will read the implicit `permissionsWithGrantOption` and attempt to revoke them when the resource is destroyed. Doing so will cause an `invalidInputException:NoPermissionsRevoked` error because you cannot revoke implicit permissions *per se*. To workaround this problem, explicitly grant the `principal`/administrator `permissions` *and* `permissionsWithGrantOption`, which can then be revoked. Similarly, granting a `principal`/administrator permissions on a table with columns and providing `columnNames`, will result in a `invalidInputException:PermissionsModificationIsInvalid` error because you are narrowing the implicit permissions. Instead, set `wildcard` to `true` and remove the `columnNames`.

## Example Usage

### Grant Permissions For A Lake Formation S3 Resource

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.lakeformationPermissions.LakeformationPermissions(this, "example", {
  dataLocation: {
    arn: "${aws_lakeformation_resource.example.arn}",
  },
  permissions: ["ALL"],
  principal: "${aws_iam_role.workflow_role.arn}",
});

```

### Grant Permissions For A Glue Catalog Database

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.lakeformationPermissions.LakeformationPermissions(this, "example", {
  database: {
    catalogId: "110376042874",
    name: "${aws_glue_catalog_database.example.name}",
  },
  permissions: ["CREATE_TABLE", "ALTER", "DROP"],
  principal: "${aws_iam_role.workflow_role.arn}",
});

```

### Grant Permissions Using Tag-Based Access Control

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.lakeformationPermissions.LakeformationPermissions(this, "test", {
  lfTagPolicy: {
    expression: [
      {
        key: "Team",
        values: ["Sales"],
      },
      {
        key: "Environment",
        values: ["Dev", "Production"],
      },
    ],
    resourceType: "DATABASE",
  },
  permissions: ["CREATE_TABLE", "ALTER", "DROP"],
  principal: "${aws_iam_role.sales_role.arn}",
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `permissions` – (Required) List of permissions granted to the principal. Valid values may include `all`, `alter`, `associate`, `CREATE_DATABASE`, `CREATE_TABLE`, `DATA_LOCATION_ACCESS`, `delete`, `describe`, `drop`, `insert`, and `select`. For details on each permission, see [Lake Formation Permissions Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/lf-permissions-reference.html).
* `principal` – (Required) Principal to be granted the permissions on the resource. Supported principals include `IAM_ALLOWED_PRINCIPALS` (see [Default Behavior and `iamAllowedPrincipals`](#default-behavior-and-iamallowedprincipals) above), IAM roles, users, groups, SAML groups and users, QuickSight groups, OUs, and organizations as well as AWS account IDs for cross-account permissions. For more information, see [Lake Formation Permissions Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/lf-permissions-reference.html).

\~> **NOTE:** We highly recommend that the `principal` *NOT* be a Lake Formation administrator (granted using `awsLakeformationDataLakeSettings`). The entity (e.g., IAM role) running Terraform will most likely need to be a Lake Formation administrator. As such, the entity will have implicit permissions and does not need permissions granted through this resource.
