# Resource: awsConfigOrganizationManagedRule

Manages a Config Organization Managed Rule. More information about these rules can be found in the [Enabling AWS Config Rules Across all Accounts in Your Organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/config-rule-multi-account-deployment.html) and [AWS Config Managed Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config_use-managed-rules.html) documentation. For working with Organization Custom Rules (those invoking a custom Lambda Function), see the [`awsConfigOrganizationCustomRule` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/config_organization_custom_rule.html).

\~> **NOTE:** This resource must be created in the Organization master account and rules will include the master account unless its ID is added to the `excludedAccounts` argument.

\~> **NOTE:** Every Organization account except those configured in the `excludedAccounts` argument must have a Configuration Recorder with proper IAM permissions before the rule will successfully create or update. See also the [`awsConfigConfigurationRecorder` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/config_configuration_recorder.html).

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsOrganizationsOrganizationExample =
  new aws.organizationsOrganization.OrganizationsOrganization(this, "example", {
    awsServiceAccessPrincipals: ["config-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com"],
    featureSet: "ALL",
  });
const awsConfigOrganizationManagedRuleExample =
  new aws.configOrganizationManagedRule.ConfigOrganizationManagedRule(
    this,
    "example_1",
    {
      depends_on: [`\${${awsOrganizationsOrganizationExample.fqn}}`],
      name: "example",
      ruleIdentifier: "IAM_PASSWORD_POLICY",
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsConfigOrganizationManagedRuleExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```
