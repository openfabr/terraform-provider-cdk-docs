# Resource: awsDirectoryServiceSharedDirectoryAccepter

Accepts a shared directory in a consumer account.

\~> **NOTE:** Destroying this resource removes the shared directory from the consumer account only.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsDirectoryServiceSharedDirectoryExample =
  new aws.directoryServiceSharedDirectory.DirectoryServiceSharedDirectory(
    this,
    "example",
    {
      directoryId: "${aws_directory_service_directory.example.id}",
      notes: "example",
      target: {
        id: "${data.aws_caller_identity.receiver.account_id}",
      },
    }
  );
const awsDirectoryServiceSharedDirectoryAccepterExample =
  new aws.directoryServiceSharedDirectoryAccepter.DirectoryServiceSharedDirectoryAccepter(
    this,
    "example_1",
    {
      provider: "awsalternate",
      sharedDirectoryId:
        awsDirectoryServiceSharedDirectoryExample.sharedDirectoryId,
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsDirectoryServiceSharedDirectoryAccepterExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```
