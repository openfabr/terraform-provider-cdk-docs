## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.

import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsDxConnectionExample = new aws.dxConnection.DxConnection(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    bandwidth: "1Gbps",
    location: "EqSe2-EQ",
    name: "example",
  }
);
const awsDxLagExample = new aws.dxLag.DxLag(this, "example_1", {
  connectionsBandwidth: "1Gbps",
  location: "EqSe2-EQ",
  name: "example",
});
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsDxLagExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const awsDxConnectionAssociationExample =
  new aws.dxConnectionAssociation.DxConnectionAssociation(this, "example_2", {
    connectionId: awsDxConnectionExample.id,
    lagId: awsDxLagExample.id,
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsDxConnectionAssociationExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
