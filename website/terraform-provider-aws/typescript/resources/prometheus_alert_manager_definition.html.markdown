## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsPrometheusWorkspaceDemo =
  new aws.prometheusWorkspace.PrometheusWorkspace(this, "demo", {});
const awsPrometheusAlertManagerDefinitionDemo =
  new aws.prometheusAlertManagerDefinition.PrometheusAlertManagerDefinition(
    this,
    "demo_1",
    {
      definition:
        "alertmanager_config: |\n  route:\n    receiver: 'default'\n  receivers:\n    - name: 'default'\n",
      workspaceId: awsPrometheusWorkspaceDemo.id,
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsPrometheusAlertManagerDefinitionDemo.overrideLogicalId("demo");

```
