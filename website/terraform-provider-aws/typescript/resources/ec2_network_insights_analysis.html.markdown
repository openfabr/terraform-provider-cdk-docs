# Resource: awsEc2NetworkInsightsAnalysis

Provides a Network Insights Analysis resource. Part of the "Reachability Analyzer" service in the AWS VPC console.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsEc2NetworkInsightsPathPath =
  new aws.ec2NetworkInsightsPath.Ec2NetworkInsightsPath(this, "path", {
    destination: "${aws_network_interface.destination.id}",
    protocol: "tcp",
    source: "${aws_network_interface.source.id}",
  });
new aws.ec2NetworkInsightsAnalysis.Ec2NetworkInsightsAnalysis(
  this,
  "analysis",
  {
    networkInsightsPathId: awsEc2NetworkInsightsPathPath.id,
  }
);

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `networkInsightsPathId` - (Required) ID of the Network Insights Path to run an analysis on.

The following arguments are optional:

* `filterInArns` - (Optional) A list of ARNs for resources the path must traverse.
* `waitForCompletion` - (Optional) If enabled, the resource will wait for the Network Insights Analysis status to change to `succeeded` or `failed`. Setting this to `false` will skip the process. Default: `true`.
* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `alternatePathHints` - Potential intermediate components of a feasible path. Described below.
* `arn` - ARN of the Network Insights Analysis.
* `explanations` - Explanation codes for an unreachable path. See the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_Explanation.html) for details.
* `forwardPathComponents` - The components in the path from source to destination. See the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_PathComponent.html) for details.
* `id` - ID of the Network Insights Analysis.
* `pathFound` - Set to `true` if the destination was reachable.
* `returnPathComponents` - The components in the path from destination to source. See the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_PathComponent.html) for details.
* `startDate` - The date/time the analysis was started.
* `status` - The status of the analysis. `succeeded` means the analysis was completed, not that a path was found, for that see `pathFound`.
* `statusMessage` - A message to provide more context when the `status` is `failed`.
* `tagsAll` - Map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block).
* `warningMessage` - The warning message.

The `alternatePathHints` object supports the following:

* `componentArn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the component.
* `componentId` - The ID of the component.

## Import

Network Insights Analyses can be imported using the `id`, e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_ec2_network_insights_analysis.test nia-0462085c957f11a55
```
