# Resource: awsCloudwatchEventArchive

Provides an EventBridge event archive resource.

\~> **Note:** EventBridge was formerly known as CloudWatch Events. The functionality is identical.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsCloudwatchEventBusOrder =
  new aws.cloudwatchEventBus.CloudwatchEventBus(this, "order", {
    name: "orders",
  });
const awsCloudwatchEventArchiveOrder =
  new aws.cloudwatchEventArchive.CloudwatchEventArchive(this, "order_1", {
    eventSourceArn: awsCloudwatchEventBusOrder.arn,
    name: "order-archive",
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsCloudwatchEventArchiveOrder.overrideLogicalId("order");

```

## Example all optional arguments

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsCloudwatchEventBusOrder =
  new aws.cloudwatchEventBus.CloudwatchEventBus(this, "order", {
    name: "orders",
  });
const awsCloudwatchEventArchiveOrder =
  new aws.cloudwatchEventArchive.CloudwatchEventArchive(this, "order_1", {
    description: "Archived events from order service",
    eventPattern: '${jsonencode({\n    source = ["company.team.order"]\n  })}',
    eventSourceArn: awsCloudwatchEventBusOrder.arn,
    name: "order-archive",
    retentionDays: 7,
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsCloudwatchEventArchiveOrder.overrideLogicalId("order");

```
