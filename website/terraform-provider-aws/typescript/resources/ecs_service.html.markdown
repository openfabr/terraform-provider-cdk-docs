  Provides an ECS service.

# Resource: awsEcsService

\-> **Note:** To prevent a race condition during service deletion, make sure to set `dependsOn` to the related `awsIamRolePolicy`; otherwise, the policy may be destroyed too soon and the ECS service will then get stuck in the `draining` state.

Provides an ECS service - effectively a task that is expected to run until an error occurs or a user terminates it (typically a webserver or a database).

See [ECS Services section in AWS developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html).

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.ecsService.EcsService(this, "mongo", {
  cluster: "${aws_ecs_cluster.foo.id}",
  depends_on: ["${aws_iam_role_policy.foo}"],
  desiredCount: 3,
  iamRole: "${aws_iam_role.foo.arn}",
  loadBalancer: [
    {
      containerName: "mongo",
      containerPort: 8080,
      targetGroupArn: "${aws_lb_target_group.foo.arn}",
    },
  ],
  name: "mongodb",
  orderedPlacementStrategy: [
    {
      field: "cpu",
      type: "binpack",
    },
  ],
  placementConstraints: [
    {
      expression: "attribute:ecs.availability-zone in [us-west-2a, us-west-2b]",
      type: "memberOf",
    },
  ],
  taskDefinition: "${aws_ecs_task_definition.mongo.arn}",
});

```

### Ignoring Changes to Desired Count

You can utilize the generic Terraform resource [lifecycle configuration block](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/meta-arguments/lifecycle.html) with `ignoreChanges` to create an ECS service with an initial count of running instances, then ignore any changes to that count caused externally (e.g., Application Autoscaling).

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsEcsServiceExample = new aws.ecsService.EcsService(this, "example", {
  desiredCount: 2,
});
awsEcsServiceExample.addOverride("lifecycle", [
  {
    ignore_changes: ["${desired_count}"],
  },
]);

```

### Daemon Scheduling Strategy

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.ecsService.EcsService(this, "bar", {
  cluster: "${aws_ecs_cluster.foo.id}",
  name: "bar",
  schedulingStrategy: "DAEMON",
  taskDefinition: "${aws_ecs_task_definition.bar.arn}",
});

```

### CloudWatch Deployment Alarms

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.ecsService.EcsService(this, "example", {
  alarms: {
    alarmNames: ["${aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm.example.alarm_name}"],
    enable: true,
    rollback: true,
  },
  cluster: "${aws_ecs_cluster.example.id}",
  name: "example",
});

```

### External Deployment Controller

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.ecsService.EcsService(this, "example", {
  cluster: "${aws_ecs_cluster.example.id}",
  deploymentController: {
    type: "EXTERNAL",
  },
  name: "example",
});

```

### Redeploy Service On Every Apply

The key used with `triggers` is arbitrary.

```terraform
resource "aws_ecs_service" "example" {
  # ... other configurations ...

  force_new_deployment = true

  triggers = {
    redeployment = timestamp()
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the service (up to 255 letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores)

The following arguments are optional:

* `alarms` - (Optional) Information about the CloudWatch alarms. [See below](#alarms).
* `capacityProviderStrategy` - (Optional) Capacity provider strategies to use for the service. Can be one or more. These can be updated without destroying and recreating the service only if `forceNewDeployment =True` and not changing from 0 `capacityProviderStrategy` blocks to greater than 0, or vice versa. See below.
* `cluster` - (Optional) ARN of an ECS cluster.
* `deploymentCircuitBreaker` - (Optional) Configuration block for deployment circuit breaker. See below.
* `deploymentController` - (Optional) Configuration block for deployment controller configuration. See below.
* `deploymentMaximumPercent` - (Optional) Upper limit (as a percentage of the service's desiredCount) of the number of running tasks that can be running in a service during a deployment. Not valid when using the `daemon` scheduling strategy.
* `deploymentMinimumHealthyPercent` - (Optional) Lower limit (as a percentage of the service's desiredCount) of the number of running tasks that must remain running and healthy in a service during a deployment.
* `desiredCount` - (Optional) Number of instances of the task definition to place and keep running. Defaults to 0. Do not specify if using the `daemon` scheduling strategy.
* `enableEcsManagedTags` - (Optional) Specifies whether to enable Amazon ECS managed tags for the tasks within the service.
* `enableExecuteCommand` - (Optional) Specifies whether to enable Amazon ECS Exec for the tasks within the service.
* `forceNewDeployment` - (Optional) Enable to force a new task deployment of the service. This can be used to update tasks to use a newer Docker image with same image/tag combination (e.g., `myimage:latest`), roll Fargate tasks onto a newer platform version, or immediately deploy `orderedPlacementStrategy` and `placementConstraints` updates.
* `healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds` - (Optional) Seconds to ignore failing load balancer health checks on newly instantiated tasks to prevent premature shutdown, up to 2147483647. Only valid for services configured to use load balancers.
* `iamRole` - (Optional) ARN of the IAM role that allows Amazon ECS to make calls to your load balancer on your behalf. This parameter is required if you are using a load balancer with your service, but only if your task definition does not use the `awsvpc` network mode. If using `awsvpc` network mode, do not specify this role. If your account has already created the Amazon ECS service-linked role, that role is used by default for your service unless you specify a role here.
* `launchType` - (Optional) Launch type on which to run your service. The valid values are `ec2`, `fargate`, and `external`. Defaults to `ec2`.
* `loadBalancer` - (Optional) Configuration block for load balancers. See below.
* `networkConfiguration` - (Optional) Network configuration for the service. This parameter is required for task definitions that use the `awsvpc` network mode to receive their own Elastic Network Interface, and it is not supported for other network modes. See below.
* `orderedPlacementStrategy` - (Optional) Service level strategy rules that are taken into consideration during task placement. List from top to bottom in order of precedence. Updates to this configuration will take effect next task deployment unless `forceNewDeployment` is enabled. The maximum number of `orderedPlacementStrategy` blocks is `5`. See below.
* `placementConstraints` - (Optional) Rules that are taken into consideration during task placement. Updates to this configuration will take effect next task deployment unless `forceNewDeployment` is enabled. Maximum number of `placementConstraints` is `10`. See below.
* `platformVersion` - (Optional) Platform version on which to run your service. Only applicable for `launchType` set to `fargate`. Defaults to `latest`. More information about Fargate platform versions can be found in the [AWS ECS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html).
* `propagateTags` - (Optional) Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the task definition or the service to the tasks. The valid values are `service` and `TASK_DEFINITION`.
* `schedulingStrategy` - (Optional) Scheduling strategy to use for the service. The valid values are `replica` and `daemon`. Defaults to `replica`. Note that [*Tasks using the Fargate launch type or the `CODE_DEPLOY` or `external` deployment controller types don't support the `daemon` scheduling strategy*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateService.html).
* `serviceConnectConfiguration` - (Optional) The ECS Service Connect configuration for this service to discover and connect to services, and be discovered by, and connected from, other services within a namespace. See below.
* `serviceRegistries` - (Optional) Service discovery registries for the service. The maximum number of `serviceRegistries` blocks is `1`. See below.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
* `taskDefinition` - (Optional) Family and revision (`family:revision`) or full ARN of the task definition that you want to run in your service. Required unless using the `external` deployment controller. If a revision is not specified, the latest `active` revision is used.
* `triggers` - (Optional) Map of arbitrary keys and values that, when changed, will trigger an in-place update (redeployment). Useful with `timestamp()`. See example above.
* `waitForSteadyState` - (Optional) If `true`, Terraform will wait for the service to reach a steady state (like [`awsEcsWaitServicesStable`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecs/wait/services-stable.html)) before continuing. Default `false`.

### alarms

The `alarms` configuration block supports the following:

* `alarmsNames` - (Required) One or more CloudWatch alarm names.
* `enable` - (Required) Determines whether to use the CloudWatch alarm option in the service deployment process.
* `rollback` - (Required) Determines whether to configure Amazon ECS to roll back the service if a service deployment fails. If rollback is used, when a service deployment fails, the service is rolled back to the last deployment that completed successfully.

### capacityProviderStrategy

The `capacityProviderStrategy` configuration block supports the following:

* `base` - (Optional) Number of tasks, at a minimum, to run on the specified capacity provider. Only one capacity provider in a capacity provider strategy can have a base defined.

* `containerName` - (Required) Name of the container to associate with the load balancer (as it appears in a container definition).
* `containerPort` - (Required) Port on the container to associate with the load balancer.

\-> **Version note:** Multiple `loadBalancer` configuration block support was added in Terraform AWS Provider version 2.22.0. This allows configuration of [ECS service support for multiple target groups](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/07/amazon-ecs-services-now-support-multiple-load-balancer-target-groups/).

### networkConfiguration

`networkConfiguration` support the following:

* `subnets` - (Required) Subnets associated with the task or service.
