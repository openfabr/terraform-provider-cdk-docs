## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.

import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.lightsailBucket.LightsailBucket(this, "test", {
  bundleId: "small_1_0",
  name: "mytestbucket",
});
const awsLightsailBucketAccessKeyAccessKeyTest =

    this,
    "test_1",
    {
      bucket_name: "${aws_lightsail_bucket_access_key.test.id}",
    }
