# Resource: aws\_chime\_voice\_connector\_origination

Enable origination settings to control inbound calling to your SIP infrastructure.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsChimeVoiceConnectorDefault =
  new aws.chimeVoiceConnector.ChimeVoiceConnector(this, "default", {
    name: "test",
    requireEncryption: true,
  });
const awsChimeVoiceConnectorOriginationDefault =
  new aws.chimeVoiceConnectorOrigination.ChimeVoiceConnectorOrigination(
    this,
    "default_1",
    {
      disabled: false,
      route: [
        {
          host: "127.0.0.1",
          port: 8081,
          priority: 1,
          protocol: "TCP",
          weight: 1,
        },
        {
          host: "127.0.0.2",
          port: 8082,
          priority: 2,
          protocol: "TCP",
          weight: 10,
        },
      ],
      voiceConnectorId: awsChimeVoiceConnectorDefault.id,
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsChimeVoiceConnectorOriginationDefault.overrideLogicalId("default");

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `voiceConnectorId` - (Required) The Amazon Chime Voice Connector ID.
* `route` - (Required) Set of call distribution properties defined for your SIP hosts. See [route](#route) below for more details. Minimum of 1. Maximum of 20.
* `disabled` - (Optional) When origination settings are disabled, inbound calls are not enabled for your Amazon Chime Voice Connector.

### `route`

Origination routes define call distribution properties for your SIP hosts to receive inbound calls using your Amazon Chime Voice Connector. Limit: Ten origination routes for each Amazon Chime Voice Connector.

* `host` - (Required) The FQDN or IP address to contact for origination traffic.
* `port` - (Required) The designated origination route port. Defaults to `5060`.
* `priority` - (Required) The priority associated with the host, with 1 being the highest priority. Higher priority hosts are attempted first.
* `protocol` - (Required) The protocol to use for the origination route. Encryption-enabled Amazon Chime Voice Connectors use TCP protocol by default.
* `weight` - (Required) The weight associated with the host. If hosts are equal in priority, calls are redistributed among them based on their relative weight.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The Amazon Chime Voice Connector ID.

## Import

Chime Voice Connector Origination can be imported using the `voiceConnectorId`, e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_chime_voice_connector_origination.default abcdef1ghij2klmno3pqr4
```
