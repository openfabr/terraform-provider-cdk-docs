import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.wafXssMatchSet.WafXssMatchSet(this, "xss_match_set", {
  name: "xss_match_set",
  xssMatchTuples: [
    {
      fieldToMatch: {
        type: "URI",
      },
      textTransformation: "NONE",
    },
    {

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name or description of the SizeConstraintSet.
* `xssMatchTuples` - (Optional) The parts of web requests that you want to inspect for cross-site scripting attacks.

## Nested Blocks

### `xssMatchTuples`

* `fieldToMatch` - (Required) Specifies where in a web request to look for cross-site scripting attacks.
* `textTransformation` - (Required) Text transformations used to eliminate unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF.
  If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF performs the transformation on `targetString` before inspecting a request for a match.
  e.g., `cmdLine`, `htmlEntityDecode` or `none`.
  See [docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/APIReference/API_XssMatchTuple.html#WAF-Type-XssMatchTuple-TextTransformation)
  for all supported values.

### `fieldToMatch`

#### Arguments

* `data` - (Optional) When `type` is `header`, enter the name of the header that you want to search, e.g., `userAgent` or `referer`.
  If `type` is any other value, omit this field.
* `type` - (Required) The part of the web request that you want AWS WAF to search for a specified string.
  e.g., `header`, `method` or `body`.
  See [docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/APIReference/API_FieldToMatch.html)
  for all supported values.
