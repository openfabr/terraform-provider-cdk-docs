## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.

import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsKmsKeyTest = new aws.kmsKey.KmsKey(this, "test", {
  deletionWindowInDays: 7,
  description: "Athena KMS Key",
});
const awsS3BucketHoge = new aws.s3Bucket.S3Bucket(this, "hoge", {
  bucket: "tf-test",
});
const awsAthenaDatabaseHoge = new aws.athenaDatabase.AthenaDatabase(
  this,
  "hoge_2",
  {
    bucket: awsS3BucketHoge.id,
    name: "users",
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsAthenaDatabaseHoge.overrideLogicalId("hoge");
const awsAthenaWorkgroupTest = new aws.athenaWorkgroup.AthenaWorkgroup(
  this,
  "test_3",
  {
    configuration: {
      resultConfiguration: {
        encryptionConfiguration: {
          encryptionOption: "SSE_KMS",
          kmsKeyArn: awsKmsKeyTest.arn,
        },
      },
    },
    name: "example",
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsAthenaWorkgroupTest.overrideLogicalId("test");
new aws.athenaNamedQuery.AthenaNamedQuery(this, "foo", {
  database: awsAthenaDatabaseHoge.name,
  name: "bar",
  query: `SELECT * FROM \${${awsAthenaDatabaseHoge.name}} limit 10;`,
  workgroup: awsAthenaWorkgroupTest.id,
