# Resource: aws\_autoscaling\_group

Provides an Auto Scaling Group resource.

\-> **Note:** You must specify either `launchConfiguration`, `launchTemplate`, or `mixedInstancesPolicy`.

\~> **NOTE on Auto Scaling Groups and ASG Attachments:** Terraform currently provides
both a standalone [`awsAutoscalingAttachment`](autoscaling_attachment.html) resource
(describing an ASG attached to an ELB or ALB), and an [`awsAutoscalingGroup`](autoscaling_group.html)
with `loadBalancers` and `targetGroupArns` defined in-line. These two methods are not
mutually-exclusive. If `awsAutoscalingAttachment` resources are used, either alone or with inline
`loadBalancers` or `targetGroupArns`, the `awsAutoscalingGroup` resource must be configured
to ignore changes to the `loadBalancers` and `targetGroupArns` arguments within a
[`lifecycle` configuration block](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/meta-arguments/lifecycle.html).

### Mixed Instances Policy

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsLaunchTemplateExample = new aws.launchTemplate.LaunchTemplate(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    imageId: "${data.aws_ami.example.id}",
    instanceType: "c5.large",
    namePrefix: "example",
  }
);
const awsAutoscalingGroupExample = new aws.autoscalingGroup.AutoscalingGroup(
  this,
  "example_1",
  {
    availabilityZones: ["us-east-1a"],
    desiredCapacity: 1,
    maxSize: 1,
    minSize: 1,
    mixedInstancesPolicy: {
      launchTemplate: {
        launchTemplateSpecification: {
          launchTemplateId: awsLaunchTemplateExample.id,
        },
        override: [
          {
            instanceType: "c4.large",
            weightedCapacity: "3",
          },
          {
            instanceType: "c3.large",
            weightedCapacity: "2",
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsAutoscalingGroupExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

### Mixed Instances Policy with Spot Instances and Capacity Rebalance

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsLaunchTemplateExample = new aws.launchTemplate.LaunchTemplate(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    imageId: "${data.aws_ami.example.id}",
    instanceType: "c5.large",
    namePrefix: "example",
  }
);
const awsAutoscalingGroupExample = new aws.autoscalingGroup.AutoscalingGroup(
  this,
  "example_1",
  {
    capacityRebalance: true,
    desiredCapacity: 12,
    maxSize: 15,
    minSize: 12,
    mixedInstancesPolicy: {
      instancesDistribution: {
        onDemandBaseCapacity: 0,
        onDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity: 25,
        spotAllocationStrategy: "capacity-optimized",
      },
      launchTemplate: {
        launchTemplateSpecification: {
          launchTemplateId: awsLaunchTemplateExample.id,
        },
        override: [
          {
            instanceType: "c4.large",
            weightedCapacity: "3",
          },
          {
            instanceType: "c3.large",
            weightedCapacity: "2",
          },
        ],
      },
    },
    vpcZoneIdentifier: [
      "${aws_subnet.example1.id}",
      "${aws_subnet.example2.id}",
    ],
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsAutoscalingGroupExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

### Mixed Instances Policy with Instance level LaunchTemplateSpecification Overrides

When using a diverse instance set, some instance types might require a launch template with configuration values unique to that instance type such as a different AMI (Graviton2), architecture specific user data script, different EBS configuration, or different networking configuration.

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsLaunchTemplateExample = new aws.launchTemplate.LaunchTemplate(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    imageId: "${data.aws_ami.example.id}",
    instanceType: "c5.large",
    namePrefix: "example",
  }
);
const awsLaunchTemplateExample2 = new aws.launchTemplate.LaunchTemplate(
  this,
  "example2",
  {
    imageId: "${data.aws_ami.example2.id}",
    namePrefix: "example2",
  }
);
const awsAutoscalingGroupExample = new aws.autoscalingGroup.AutoscalingGroup(
  this,
  "example_2",
  {
    availabilityZones: ["us-east-1a"],
    desiredCapacity: 1,
    maxSize: 1,
    minSize: 1,
    mixedInstancesPolicy: {
      launchTemplate: {
        launchTemplateSpecification: {
          launchTemplateId: awsLaunchTemplateExample.id,
        },
        override: [
          {
            instanceType: "c4.large",
            weightedCapacity: "3",
          },
          {
            instanceType: "c6g.large",
            launchTemplateSpecification: {
              launchTemplateId: awsLaunchTemplateExample2.id,
            },
            weightedCapacity: "2",
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsAutoscalingGroupExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

### Mixed Instances Policy with Attribute-based Instance Type Selection

As an alternative to manually choosing instance types when creating a mixed instances group, you can specify a set of instance attributes that describe your compute requirements.

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsLaunchTemplateExample = new aws.launchTemplate.LaunchTemplate(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    imageId: "${data.aws_ami.example.id}",
    instanceType: "c5.large",
    namePrefix: "example",
  }
);
const awsAutoscalingGroupExample = new aws.autoscalingGroup.AutoscalingGroup(
  this,
  "example_1",
  {
    availabilityZones: ["us-east-1a"],
    desiredCapacity: 1,
    maxSize: 1,
    minSize: 1,
    mixedInstancesPolicy: {
      launchTemplate: {
        launchTemplateSpecification: {
          launchTemplateId: awsLaunchTemplateExample.id,
        },
        override: [
          {
            instanceRequirements: {
              memoryMib: {
                min: 1000,
              },
              vcpuCount: {
                min: 4,
              },
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsAutoscalingGroupExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

### Interpolated tags

```typescript
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
/*Terraform Variables are not always the best fit for getting inputs in the context of Terraform CDK.
You can read more about this at https://cdk.tf/variables*/
const extraTags = new cdktf.TerraformVariable(this, "extra_tags", {
  default: [
    {
      key: "Foo",
      propagate_at_launch: true,
      value: "Bar",
    },
    {
      key: "Baz",
      propagate_at_launch: true,
      value: "Bam",
    },
  ],
});
new aws.autoscalingGroup.AutoscalingGroup(this, "bar", {
  launchConfiguration: "${aws_launch_configuration.foobar.name}",
  maxSize: 5,
  minSize: 2,
  name: "foobar3-terraform-test",
  tags: `\${concat(
    [
      {
        "key"                 = "interpolation1"
        "value"               = "value3"
        "propagate_at_launch" = true
      },
      {
        "key"                 = "interpolation2"
        "value"               = "value4"
        "propagate_at_launch" = true
      },
    ],
    ${extraTags.value},
  )}`,
  vpcZoneIdentifier: ["${aws_subnet.example1.id}", "${aws_subnet.example2.id}"],
});

```

### Automatically refresh all instances after the group is updated

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const dataAwsAmiExample = new aws.dataAwsAmi.DataAwsAmi(this, "example", {
  filter: [
    {
      name: "name",
      values: ["amzn-ami-hvm-*-x86_64-gp2"],
    },
  ],
  mostRecent: true,
  owners: ["amazon"],
});
const awsLaunchTemplateExample = new aws.launchTemplate.LaunchTemplate(
  this,
  "example_1",
  {
    imageId: dataAwsAmiExample.id,
    instanceType: "t3.nano",
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsLaunchTemplateExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const awsAutoscalingGroupExample = new aws.autoscalingGroup.AutoscalingGroup(
  this,
  "example_2",
  {
    availabilityZones: ["us-east-1a"],
    desiredCapacity: 1,
    instanceRefresh: {
      preferences: {
        minHealthyPercentage: 50,
      },
      strategy: "Rolling",
      triggers: ["tag"],
    },
    launchTemplate: {
      id: awsLaunchTemplateExample.id,
      version: awsLaunchTemplateExample.latestVersion,
    },
    maxSize: 2,
    minSize: 1,
    tag: [
      {
        key: "Key",
        propagateAtLaunch: true,
        value: "Value",
      },
    ],
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsAutoscalingGroupExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

### Auto Scaling group with Warm Pool

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.autoscalingGroup.AutoscalingGroup(this, "example", {
  availabilityZones: ["us-east-1a"],
  desiredCapacity: 1,
  maxSize: 5,
  minSize: 1,
  warmPool: {
    instanceReusePolicy: {
      reuseOnScaleIn: true,
    },
    maxGroupPreparedCapacity: 10,
    minSize: 1,
    poolState: "Hibernated",
  },
});
const awsLaunchTemplateExample = new aws.launchTemplate.LaunchTemplate(
  this,
  "example_1",
  {
    imageId: "${data.aws_ami.example.id}",
    instanceType: "c5.large",
    namePrefix: "example",
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsLaunchTemplateExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Optional) Name of the Auto Scaling Group. By default generated by Terraform. Conflicts with `namePrefix`.
* `namePrefix` - (Optional) Creates a unique name beginning with the specified
  prefix. Conflicts with `name`.
* `maxSize` - (Required) Maximum size of the Auto Scaling Group.
* `minSize` - (Required) Minimum size of the Auto Scaling Group.
  (See also [Waiting for Capacity](#waiting-for-capacity) below.)
* `availabilityZones` - (Optional) List of one or more availability zones for the group. Used for EC2-Classic, attaching a network interface via id from a launch template and default subnets when not specified with `vpcZoneIdentifier` argument. Conflicts with `vpcZoneIdentifier`.
* `capacityRebalance` - (Optional) Whether capacity rebalance is enabled. Otherwise, capacity rebalance is disabled.
* `context` - (Optional) Reserved.
* `defaultCooldown` - (Optional) Amount of time, in seconds, after a scaling activity completes before another scaling activity can start.
* `defaultInstanceWarmup` - (Optional) Amount of time, in seconds, until a newly launched instance can contribute to the Amazon CloudWatch metrics. This delay lets an instance finish initializing before Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling aggregates instance metrics, resulting in more reliable usage data. Set this value equal to the amount of time that it takes for resource consumption to become stable after an instance reaches the InService state. (See [Set the default instance warmup for an Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-default-instance-warmup.html))
* `launchConfiguration` - (Optional) Name of the launch configuration to use.
* `launchTemplate` - (Optional) Nested argument with Launch template specification to use to launch instances. See [Launch Template](#launch_template) below for more details.
* `mixedInstancesPolicy` (Optional) Configuration block containing settings to define launch targets for Auto Scaling groups. See [Mixed Instances Policy](#mixed_instances_policy) below for more details.
* `initialLifecycleHook` - (Optional) One or more
  [Lifecycle Hooks](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/latest/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html)
  to attach to the Auto Scaling Group **before** instances are launched. The
  syntax is exactly the same as the separate
  [`awsAutoscalingLifecycleHook`](/docs/providers/aws/r/autoscaling_lifecycle_hook.html)
  resource, without the `autoscalingGroupName` attribute. Please note that this will only work when creating
  a new Auto Scaling Group. For all other use-cases, please use `awsAutoscalingLifecycleHook` resource.
* `healthCheckGracePeriod` - (Optional, Default: 300) Time (in seconds) after instance comes into service before checking health.
* `healthCheckType` - (Optional) "EC2" or "ELB". Controls how health checking is done.
* `desiredCapacity` - (Optional) Number of Amazon EC2 instances that
  should be running in the group. (See also [Waiting for
  Capacity](#waiting-for-capacity) below.)
* `desiredCapacityType` - (Optional) The unit of measurement for the value specified for `desiredCapacity`. Supported for attribute-based instance type selection only. Valid values: `"units"`, `"vcpu"`, `"memoryMib"`.
* `forceDelete` - (Optional) Allows deleting the Auto Scaling Group without waiting
  for all instances in the pool to terminate.  You can force an Auto Scaling Group to delete
  even if it's in the process of scaling a resource. Normally, Terraform
  drains all the instances before deleting the group.  This bypasses that
  behavior and potentially leaves resources dangling.
* `loadBalancers` (Optional) List of elastic load balancer names to add to the autoscaling
  group names. Only valid for classic load balancers. For ALBs, use `targetGroupArns` instead.
* `vpcZoneIdentifier` (Optional) List of subnet IDs to launch resources in. Subnets automatically determine which availability zones the group will reside. Conflicts with `availabilityZones`.
* `targetGroupArns` (Optional) Set of `awsAlbTargetGroup` ARNs, for use with Application or Network Load Balancing.
* `terminationPolicies` (Optional) List of policies to decide how the instances in the Auto Scaling Group should be terminated. The allowed values are `oldestInstance`, `newestInstance`, `oldestLaunchConfiguration`, `closestToNextInstanceHour`, `oldestLaunchTemplate`, `allocationStrategy`, `default`. Additionally, the ARN of a Lambda function can be specified for custom termination policies.
* `suspendedProcesses` - (Optional) List of processes to suspend for the Auto Scaling Group. The allowed values are `launch`, `terminate`, `healthCheck`, `replaceUnhealthy`, `azRebalance`, `alarmNotification`, `scheduledActions`, `addToLoadBalancer`, `instanceRefresh`.
  Note that if you suspend either the `launch` or `terminate` process types, it can prevent your Auto Scaling Group from functioning properly.
* `tag` (Optional) Configuration block(s) containing resource tags. Conflicts with `tags`. See [Tag](#tag-and-tags) below for more details.
* `tags` (Optional, **Deprecated** use `tag` instead) Set of maps containing resource tags. Conflicts with `tag`. See [Tags](#tag-and-tags) below for more details.
* `placementGroup` (Optional) Name of the placement group into which you'll launch your instances, if any.
* `metricsGranularity` - (Optional) Granularity to associate with the metrics to collect. The only valid value is `1Minute`. Default is `1Minute`.
* `enabledMetrics` - (Optional) List of metrics to collect. The allowed values are defined by the [underlying AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_EnableMetricsCollection.html).
* `waitForCapacityTimeout` (Default: "10m") Maximum
  [duration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) that Terraform should
  wait for ASG instances to be healthy before timing out.  (See also [Waiting
  for Capacity](#waiting-for-capacity) below.) Setting this to "0" causes
  Terraform to skip all Capacity Waiting behavior.
* `minElbCapacity` - (Optional) Setting this causes Terraform to wait for
  this number of instances from this Auto Scaling Group to show up healthy in the
  ELB only on creation. Updates will not wait on ELB instance number changes.
  (See also [Waiting for Capacity](#waiting-for-capacity) below.)
* `waitForElbCapacity` - (Optional) Setting this will cause Terraform to wait
  for exactly this number of healthy instances from this Auto Scaling Group in
  all attached load balancers on both create and update operations. (Takes
  precedence over `minElbCapacity` behavior.)
  (See also [Waiting for Capacity](#waiting-for-capacity) below.)
* `protectFromScaleIn` (Optional) Whether newly launched instances
  are automatically protected from termination by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling when
  scaling in. For more information about preventing instances from terminating
  on scale in, see [Using instance scale-in protection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-instance-protection.html)
  in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
* `serviceLinkedRoleArn` (Optional) ARN of the service-linked role that the ASG will use to call other AWS services
* `maxInstanceLifetime` (Optional) Maximum amount of time, in seconds, that an instance can be in service, values must be either equal to 0 or between 86400 and 31536000 seconds.
* `instanceRefresh` - (Optional) If this block is configured, start an
  [Instance Refresh](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-refresh.html)
  when this Auto Scaling Group is updated. Defined [below](#instance_refresh).
* `warmPool` - (Optional) If this block is configured, add a [Warm Pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-warm-pools.html)
  to the specified Auto Scaling group. Defined [below](#warm_pool)

The top-level `launchTemplate` block supports the following:

* `id` - (Optional) ID of the launch template. Conflicts with `name`.
* `name` - (Optional) Name of the launch template. Conflicts with `id`.
* `version` - (Optional) Template version. Can be version number, `$latest`, or `$default`. (Default: `$default`).

### mixed\_instances\_policy

* `instancesDistribution` - (Optional) Nested argument containing settings on how to mix on-demand and Spot instances in the Auto Scaling group. Defined below.
* `launchTemplate` - (Required) Nested argument containing launch template settings along with the overrides to specify multiple instance types and weights. Defined below.

#### mixed\_instances\_policy instances\_distribution

This configuration block supports the following:

* `onDemandAllocationStrategy` - (Optional) Strategy to use when launching on-demand instances. Valid values: `prioritized`, `lowestPrice`. Default: `prioritized`.

### tag and tags

The `tag` attribute accepts exactly one tag declaration with the following fields:

* `key` - (Required) Key
* `value` - (Required) Value
* `propagateAtLaunch` - (Required) Enables propagation of the tag to
  Amazon EC2 instances launched via this ASG

To declare multiple tags additional `tag` blocks can be specified.
Alternatively the `tags` attributes can be used, which accepts a list of maps containing the above field names as keys and their respective values.
This allows the construction of dynamic lists of tags which is not possible using the single `tag` attribute.
`tag` and `tags` are mutually exclusive, only one of them can be specified.

\~> **NOTE:** Other AWS APIs may automatically add special tags to their associated Auto Scaling Group for management purposes, such as ECS Capacity Providers adding the `amazonEcsManaged` tag. These generally should be included in the configuration so Terraform does not attempt to remove them and so if the `minSize` was greater than zero on creation, that these tag(s) are applied to any initial EC2 Instances in the Auto Scaling Group. If these tag(s) were missing in the Auto Scaling Group configuration on creation, affected EC2 Instances missing the tags may require manual intervention of adding the tags to ensure they work properly with the other AWS service.

### instance\_refresh

This configuration block supports the following:

* `strategy` - (Required) Strategy to use for instance refresh. The only allowed value is `rolling`. See [StartInstanceRefresh Action](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_StartInstanceRefresh.html#API_StartInstanceRefresh_RequestParameters) for more information.
* `preferences` - (Optional) Override default parameters for Instance Refresh.
  * `checkpointDelay` - (Optional) Number of seconds to wait after a checkpoint. Defaults to `3600`.
  * `checkpointPercentages` - (Optional) List of percentages for each checkpoint. Values must be unique and in ascending order. To replace all instances, the final number must be `100`.
  * `instanceWarmup` - (Optional) Number of seconds until a newly launched instance is configured and ready to use. Default behavior is to use the Auto Scaling Group's health check grace period.
  * `minHealthyPercentage` - (Optional) Amount of capacity in the Auto Scaling group that must remain healthy during an instance refresh to allow the operation to continue, as a percentage of the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group. Defaults to `90`.
  * `skipMatching` - (Optional) Replace instances that already have your desired configuration. Defaults to `false`.
* `triggers` - (Optional) Set of additional property names that will trigger an Instance Refresh. A refresh will always be triggered by a change in any of `launchConfiguration`, `launchTemplate`, or `mixedInstancesPolicy`.

\~> **NOTE:** A refresh is started when any of the following Auto Scaling Group properties change: `launchConfiguration`, `launchTemplate`, `mixedInstancesPolicy`. Additional properties can be specified in the `triggers` property of `instanceRefresh`.

\~> **NOTE:** A refresh will not start when `version = "$latest"` is configured in the `launchTemplate` block. To trigger the instance refresh when a launch template is changed, configure `version` to use the `latestVersion` attribute of the `awsLaunchTemplate` resource.

\~> **NOTE:** Auto Scaling Groups support up to one active instance refresh at a time. When this resource is updated, any existing refresh is cancelled.

\~> **NOTE:** Depending on health check settings and group size, an instance refresh may take a long time or fail. This resource does not wait for the instance refresh to complete.

### warm\_pool

This configuration block supports the following:

* `poolState` - (Optional) Sets the instance state to transition to after the lifecycle hooks finish. Valid values are: Stopped (default), Running or Hibernated.
* `minSize` - (Optional) Minimum number of instances to maintain in the warm pool. This helps you to ensure that there is always a certain number of warmed instances available to handle traffic spikes. Defaults to 0 if not specified.
* `instanceReusePolicy` - (Optional) Whether instances in the Auto Scaling group can be returned to the warm pool on scale in. The default is to terminate instances in the Auto Scaling group when the group scales in.
* `maxGroupPreparedCapacity` - (Optional) Total maximum number of instances that are allowed to be in the warm pool or in any state except Terminated for the Auto Scaling group.

##### instance\_reuse\_policy

This configuration block supports the following:

* `reuseOnScaleIn` - (Optional) Whether instances in the Auto Scaling group can be returned to the warm pool on scale in.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - Auto Scaling Group id.
* `arn` - ARN for this Auto Scaling Group
* `availabilityZones` - Availability zones of the Auto Scaling Group.
* `minSize` - Minimum size of the Auto Scaling Group
* `maxSize` - Maximum size of the Auto Scaling Group
* `defaultCooldown` - Time between a scaling activity and the succeeding scaling activity.
* `defaultInstanceWarmup` - The duration of the default instance warmup, in seconds.
* `name` - Name of the Auto Scaling Group
* `healthCheckGracePeriod` - Time after instance comes into service before checking health.
* `healthCheckType` - "EC2" or "ELB". Controls how health checking is done.
* `desiredCapacity` -The number of Amazon EC2 instances that should be running in the group.
* `launchConfiguration` - The launch configuration of the Auto Scaling Group
* `vpcZoneIdentifier` (Optional) - The VPC zone identifier

\~> **NOTE:** When using `elb` as the `healthCheckType`, `healthCheckGracePeriod` is required.

\~> **NOTE:** Terraform has two types of ways you can add lifecycle hooks - via
the `initialLifecycleHook` attribute from this resource, or via the separate
[`awsAutoscalingLifecycleHook`](/docs/providers/aws/r/autoscaling_lifecycle_hook.html)
resource. `initialLifecycleHook` exists here because any lifecycle hooks
added with `awsAutoscalingLifecycleHook` will not be added until the
Auto Scaling Group has been created, and depending on your
[capacity](#waiting-for-capacity) settings, after the initial instances have
been launched, creating unintended behavior. If you need hooks to run on all
instances, add them with `initialLifecycleHook` here, but take
care to not duplicate these hooks in `awsAutoscalingLifecycleHook`.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

* `delete` - (Default `10M`)

## Waiting for Capacity

A newly-created ASG is initially empty and begins to scale to `minSize` (or
`desiredCapacity`, if specified) by launching instances using the provided
Launch Configuration. These instances take time to launch and boot.

On ASG Update, changes to these values also take time to result in the target
number of instances providing service.

Terraform provides two mechanisms to help consistently manage ASG scale up
time across dependent resources.

#### Waiting for ASG Capacity

The first is default behavior. Terraform waits after ASG creation for
`minSize` (or `desiredCapacity`, if specified) healthy instances to show up
in the ASG before continuing.

If `minSize` or `desiredCapacity` are changed in a subsequent update,
Terraform will also wait for the correct number of healthy instances before
continuing.

Terraform considers an instance "healthy" when the ASG reports `healthStatus:
"healthy"` and `lifecycleState: "inService"`. See the [AWS AutoScaling
Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/DeveloperGuide/AutoScalingGroupLifecycle.html)
for more information on an ASG's lifecycle.

Terraform will wait for healthy instances for up to
`waitForCapacityTimeout`. If ASG creation is taking more than a few minutes,
it's worth investigating for scaling activity errors, which can be caused by
problems with the selected Launch Configuration.

Setting `waitForCapacityTimeout` to `"0"` disables ASG Capacity waiting.

#### Waiting for ELB Capacity

The second mechanism is optional, and affects ASGs with attached ELBs specified
via the `loadBalancers` attribute or with ALBs specified with `targetGroupArns`.

The `minElbCapacity` parameter causes Terraform to wait for at least the
requested number of instances to show up `"inService"` in all attached ELBs
during ASG creation.  It has no effect on ASG updates.

If `waitForElbCapacity` is set, Terraform will wait for exactly that number
of Instances to be `"inService"` in all attached ELBs on both creation and
updates.

These parameters can be used to ensure that service is being provided before
Terraform moves on. If new instances don't pass the ELB's health checks for any
reason, the Terraform apply will time out, and the ASG will be marked as
tainted (i.e., marked to be destroyed in a follow up run).

As with ASG Capacity, Terraform will wait for up to `waitForCapacityTimeout`
for the proper number of instances to be healthy.

#### Troubleshooting Capacity Waiting Timeouts

If ASG creation takes more than a few minutes, this could indicate one of a
number of configuration problems. See the [AWS Docs on Load Balancer
Troubleshooting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/elb-troubleshooting.html)
for more information.
