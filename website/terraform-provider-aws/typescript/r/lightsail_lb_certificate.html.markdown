# Resource: aws\_lightsail\_lb\_certificate

Creates a Lightsail load balancer Certificate resource.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsLightsailLbTest = new aws.lightsailLb.LightsailLb(this, "test", {
  healthCheckPath: "/",
  instancePort: "80",
  name: "test-load-balancer",
  tags: {
    foo: "bar",
  },
});
const awsLightsailLbCertificateTest =
  new aws.lightsailLbCertificate.LightsailLbCertificate(this, "test_1", {
    domainName: "test.com",
    lbName: awsLightsailLbTest.id,
    name: "test-load-balancer-certificate",
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsLightsailLbCertificateTest.overrideLogicalId("test");

```
