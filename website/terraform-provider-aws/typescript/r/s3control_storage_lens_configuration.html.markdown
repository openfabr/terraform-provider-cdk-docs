```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const dataAwsCallerIdentityCurrent =
  new aws.dataAwsCallerIdentity.DataAwsCallerIdentity(this, "current", {});
new aws.s3ControlStorageLensConfiguration.S3ControlStorageLensConfiguration(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    configId: "example-1",
    storageLensConfiguration: {
      accountLevel: {
        activityMetrics: {
          enabled: true,
        },
        bucketLevel: {
          activityMetrics: {
            enabled: true,
          },
        },
      },
      dataExport: {
        cloudWatchMetrics: {
          enabled: true,
        },
        s3BucketDestination: {
          accountId: dataAwsCallerIdentityCurrent.accountId,
          arn: "${aws_s3_bucket.target.arn}",
