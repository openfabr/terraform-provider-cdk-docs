# Resource: aws\_emr\_cluster

Provides an Elastic MapReduce Cluster, a web service that makes it easy to process large amounts of data efficiently. See [Amazon Elastic MapReduce Documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/elastic-mapreduce/) for more information.

To configure [Instance Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-instance-group-configuration.html#emr-plan-instance-groups) for [task nodes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-master-core-task-nodes.html#emr-plan-task), see the [`awsEmrInstanceGroup` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/emr_instance_group.html).

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";

```

The `awsEmrCluster` resource typically requires two IAM roles, one for the EMR Cluster to use as a service, and another to place on your Cluster Instances to interact with AWS from those instances. The suggested role policy template for the EMR service is `amazonElasticMapReduceRole`, and `amazonElasticMapReduceforEc2Role` for the EC2 profile. See the [Getting Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-gs-launch-sample-cluster.html) guide for more information on these IAM roles. There is also a fully-bootable example Terraform configuration at the bottom of this page.

### Instance Fleet

```typescript

});

```

### Enable Debug Logging

[Debug logging in EMR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-plan-debugging.html) is implemented as a step. It is highly recommended that you utilize the [lifecycle configuration block](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/meta-arguments/lifecycle.html) with `ignoreChanges` if other steps are being managed outside of Terraform.

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsEmrClusterExample = new aws.emrCluster.EmrCluster(this, "example", {
  step: [
    {
      actionOnFailure: "TERMINATE_CLUSTER",
      hadoopJarStep: [
        {
          args: ["state-pusher-script"],
          jar: "command-runner.jar",
        },
      ],
      name: "Setup Hadoop Debugging",
    },
  ],
});
awsEmrClusterExample.addOverride("lifecycle", [
  {
    ignore_changes: ["${step}"],
  },
]);

```

### Multiple Node Master Instance Group

Available in EMR version 5.23.0 and later, an EMR Cluster can be launched with three master nodes for high availability. Additional information about this functionality and its requirements can be found in the [EMR Management Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-plan-ha.html).

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsSubnetExample = new aws.subnet.Subnet(this, "example", {
  mapPublicIpOnLaunch: true,
});
const awsEmrClusterExample = new aws.emrCluster.EmrCluster(this, "example_1", {
  coreInstanceGroup: {},
  ec2Attributes: {
    subnetId: awsSubnetExample.id,
  },
  masterInstanceGroup: {
    instanceCount: 3,
  },
  releaseLabel: "emr-5.24.1",
  terminationProtection: true,
});
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsEmrClusterExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

### Bootable Cluster

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the job flow.
* `releaseLabel` - (Required) Release label for the Amazon EMR release.
* `serviceRole` - (Required) IAM role that will be assumed by the Amazon EMR service to access AWS resources.

The following arguments are optional:

* `additionalInfo` - (Optional) JSON string for selecting additional features such as adding proxy information. Note: Currently there is no API to retrieve the value of this argument after EMR cluster creation from provider, therefore Terraform cannot detect drift from the actual EMR cluster if its value is changed outside Terraform.
* `applications` - (Optional) A case-insensitive list of applications for Amazon EMR to install and configure when launching the cluster. For a list of applications available for each Amazon EMR release version, see the [Amazon EMR Release Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/emr-release-components.html).
* `autoscalingRole` - (Optional) IAM role for automatic scaling policies. The IAM role provides permissions that the automatic scaling feature requires to launch and terminate EC2 instances in an instance group.
* `autoTerminationPolicy` - (Optional) An auto-termination policy for an Amazon EMR cluster. An auto-termination policy defines the amount of idle time in seconds after which a cluster automatically terminates. See [Auto Termination Policy](#auto_termination_policy) Below.
* `bootstrapAction` - (Optional) Ordered list of bootstrap actions that will be run before Hadoop is started on the cluster nodes. See below.
* `configurations` - (Optional) List of configurations supplied for the EMR cluster you are creating. Supply a configuration object for applications to override their default configuration. See [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/emr-configure-apps.html) for more information.
* `configurationsJson` - (Optional) JSON string for supplying list of configurations for the EMR cluster.

\~> **NOTE on `configurationsJson`:** If the `configurations` value is empty then you should skip the `configurations` field instead of providing an empty list as a value, `"configurations": []`.

* `subnetIds` - (Optional) List of VPC subnet id-s where you want the job flow to launch.  Amazon EMR identifies the best Availability Zone to launch instances according to your fleet specifications.

\~> **NOTE on EMR-Managed security groups:** These security groups will have any missing inbound or outbound access rules added and maintained by AWS, to ensure proper communication between instances in a cluster. The EMR service will maintain these rules for groups provided in `emrManagedMasterSecurityGroup` and `emrManagedSlaveSecurityGroup`; attempts to remove the required rules may succeed, only for the EMR service to re-add them in a matter of minutes. This may cause Terraform to fail to destroy an environment that contains an EMR cluster, because the EMR service does not revoke rules added on deletion, leaving a cyclic dependency between the security groups that prevents their deletion. To avoid this, use the `revokeRulesOnDelete` optional attribute for any Security Group used in `emrManagedMasterSecurityGroup` and `emrManagedSlaveSecurityGroup`. See [Amazon EMR-Managed Security Groups](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-man-sec-groups.html) for more information about the EMR-managed security group rules.

## Import

EMR clusters can be imported using the `id`, e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_emr_cluster.cluster j-123456ABCDEF
```

Since the API does not return the actual values for Kerberos configurations, environments with those Terraform configurations will need to use the [`lifecycle` configuration block `ignoreChanges` argument](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/meta-arguments/lifecycle.html#ignore_changes) available to all Terraform resources to prevent perpetual differences, e.g.,

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsEmrClusterExample = new aws.emrCluster.EmrCluster(this, "example", {});
awsEmrClusterExample.addOverride("lifecycle", [
  {
    ignore_changes: ["${kerberos_attributes}"],
  },
]);

```
