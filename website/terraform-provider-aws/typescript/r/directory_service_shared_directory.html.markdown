import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsDirectoryServiceDirectoryExample =
  new aws.directoryServiceDirectory.DirectoryServiceDirectory(this, "example", {
    edition: "Standard",
    name: "tf-example",
    password: "SuperSecretPassw0rd",
    type: "MicrosoftAD",
    vpcSettings: {
      subnetIds: "${aws_subnet.example[*].id}",
      vpcId: "${aws_vpc.example.id}",
    },
  });
const awsDirectoryServiceSharedDirectoryExample =
  new aws.directoryServiceSharedDirectory.DirectoryServiceSharedDirectory(
    this,
    "example_1",
    {
      directoryId: awsDirectoryServiceDirectoryExample.id,
      notes: "You wanna have a catch?",
      target: {
        id: "${data.aws_caller_identity.receiver.account_id}",
      },
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsDirectoryServiceSharedDirectoryExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
