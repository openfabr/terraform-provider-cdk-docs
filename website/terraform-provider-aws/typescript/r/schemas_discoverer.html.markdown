# Resource: aws\_schemas\_discoverer

Provides an EventBridge Schema Discoverer resource.

\~> **Note:** EventBridge was formerly known as CloudWatch Events. The functionality is identical.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsCloudwatchEventBusMessenger =
  new aws.cloudwatchEventBus.CloudwatchEventBus(this, "messenger", {
    name: "chat-messages",
  });
new aws.schemasDiscoverer.SchemasDiscoverer(this, "test", {
  description: "Auto discover event schemas",
  sourceArn: awsCloudwatchEventBusMessenger.arn,
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `sourceArn` - (Required) The ARN of the event bus to discover event schemas on.
* `description` - (Optional) The description of the discoverer. Maximum of 256 characters.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the discoverer.
* `id` - The ID of the discoverer.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

EventBridge discoverers can be imported using the `id`, e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_schemas_discoverer.test 123
```
