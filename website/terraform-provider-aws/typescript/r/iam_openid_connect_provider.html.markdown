# Resource: aws\_iam\_openid\_connect\_provider

Provides an IAM OpenID Connect provider.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.iamOpenidConnectProvider.IamOpenidConnectProvider(this, "default", {
  clientIdList: ["266362248691-342342xasdasdasda-apps.googleusercontent.com"],
  thumbprintList: [],
  url: "https://accounts.google.com",
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `url` - (Required) The URL of the identity provider. Corresponds to the *iss* claim.
* `clientIdList` - (Required) A list of client IDs (also known as audiences). When a mobile or web app registers with an OpenID Connect provider, they establish a value that identifies the application. (This is the value that's sent as the client\_id parameter on OAuth requests.)
* `thumbprintList` - (Required) A list of server certificate thumbprints for the OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider's server certificate(s).
* `tags` - (Optional) Map of resource tags for the IAM OIDC provider. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - The ARN assigned by AWS for this provider.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

IAM OpenID Connect Providers can be imported using the `arn`, e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_iam_openid_connect_provider.default arn:aws:iam::123456789012:oidc-provider/accounts.google.com
```
