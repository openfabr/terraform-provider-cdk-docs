# Resource: aws\_vpc\_endpoint\_subnet\_association

Provides a resource to create an association between a VPC endpoint and a subnet.

\~> **NOTE on VPC Endpoints and VPC Endpoint Subnet Associations:** Terraform provides
both a standalone VPC Endpoint Subnet Association (an association between a VPC endpoint
and a single `subnetId`) and a [VPC Endpoint](vpc_endpoint.html) resource with a `subnetIds`
attribute. Do not use the same subnet ID in both a VPC Endpoint resource and a VPC Endpoint Subnet
Association resource. Doing so will cause a conflict of associations and will overwrite the association.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.vpcEndpointSubnetAssociation.VpcEndpointSubnetAssociation(
  this,
  "sn_ec2",
  {
    subnetId: "${aws_subnet.sn.id}",
    vpcEndpointId: "${aws_vpc_endpoint.ec2.id}",
  }
);

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `vpcEndpointId` - (Required) The ID of the VPC endpoint with which the subnet will be associated.
* `subnetId` - (Required) The ID of the subnet to be associated with the VPC endpoint.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the association.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

* `create` - (Default `10M`)
* `delete` - (Default `10M`)

## Import

VPC Endpoint Subnet Associations can be imported using `vpcEndpointId` together with `subnetId`,
e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_vpc_endpoint_subnet_association.example vpce-aaaaaaaa/subnet-bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
```
