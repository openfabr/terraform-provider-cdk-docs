# Resource: aws\_rds\_reserved\_instance

Manages an RDS DB Reserved Instance.

\~> **NOTE:** Once created, a reservation is valid for the `duration` of the provided `offeringId` and cannot be deleted. Performing a `destroy` will only remove the resource from state. For more information see [RDS Reserved Instances Documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/reserved-instances/) and [PurchaseReservedDBInstancesOffering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_PurchaseReservedDBInstancesOffering.html).

\~> **NOTE:** Due to the expense of testing this resource, we provide it as best effort. If you find it useful, and have the ability to help test or notice issues, consider reaching out to us on [GitHub](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws).

  new aws.dataAwsRdsReservedInstanceOffering.DataAwsRdsReservedInstanceOffering(
    this,
    "test",
    {
      dbInstanceClass: "db.t2.micro",
      duration: 31536000,
      multiAz: false,
      offeringType: "All Upfront",
      productDescription: "mysql",
    }
  );
new aws.rdsReservedInstance.RdsReservedInstance(this, "example", {
  instanceCount: 3,
