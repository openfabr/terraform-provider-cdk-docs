# Resource: aws\_resourceexplorer2\_view

Provides a resource to manage a Resource Explorer view.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsResourceexplorer2IndexExample =
  new aws.resourceexplorer2Index.Resourceexplorer2Index(this, "example", {
    type: "LOCAL",
  });
const awsResourceexplorer2ViewExample =
  new aws.resourceexplorer2View.Resourceexplorer2View(this, "example_1", {
    depends_on: [`\${${awsResourceexplorer2IndexExample.fqn}}`],
    filters: [
      {
        filterString: "resourcetype:ec2:instance",
      },
    ],
    includedProperty: [
      {
        name: "tags",
      },
    ],
    name: "exampleview",
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsResourceexplorer2ViewExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `defaultView` - (Optional) Specifies whether the view is the [*default view*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-views-about.html#manage-views-about-default) for the AWS Region. Default: `false`.
* `filters` - (Optional) Specifies which resources are included in the results of queries made using this view. See [Filters](#filters) below for more details.
* `includedProperty` - (Optional) Optional fields to be included in search results from this view. See [Included Properties](#included-properties) below for more details.
