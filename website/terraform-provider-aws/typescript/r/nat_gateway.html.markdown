# Resource: aws\_nat\_gateway

Provides a resource to create a VPC NAT Gateway.

## Example Usage

### Public NAT

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.natGateway.NatGateway(this, "example", {
  allocationId: "${aws_eip.example.id}",
  depends_on: ["${aws_internet_gateway.example}"],
  subnetId: "${aws_subnet.example.id}",
  tags: {
    Name: "gw NAT",
  },
});

```

### Private NAT

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.natGateway.NatGateway(this, "example", {
  connectivityType: "private",
  subnetId: "${aws_subnet.example.id}",
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `allocationId` - (Optional) The Allocation ID of the Elastic IP address for the gateway. Required for `connectivityType` of `public`.
* `connectivityType` - (Optional) Connectivity type for the gateway. Valid values are `private` and `public`. Defaults to `public`.
* `privateIp` - (Optional) The private IPv4 address to assign to the NAT gateway. If you don't provide an address, a private IPv4 address will be automatically assigned.
* `subnetId` - (Required) The Subnet ID of the subnet in which to place the gateway.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the NAT Gateway.
* `networkInterfaceId` - The ID of the network interface associated with the NAT gateway.
* `publicIp` - The Elastic IP address associated with the NAT gateway.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

NAT Gateways can be imported using the `id`, e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_nat_gateway.private_gw nat-05dba92075d71c408
```
