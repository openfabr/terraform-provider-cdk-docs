# Resource: aws\_route53domains\_registered\_domain

Provides a resource to manage a domain that has been [registered](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/registrar-tld-list.html) and associated with the current AWS account.

**This is an advanced resource** and has special caveats to be aware of when using it. Please read this document in its entirety before using this resource.

The `awsRoute53DomainsRegisteredDomain` resource behaves differently from normal resources in that if a domain has been registered, Terraform does not *register* this domain, but instead "adopts" it into management. `terraformDestroy` does not delete the domain but does remove the resource from Terraform state.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.route53DomainsRegisteredDomain.Route53DomainsRegisteredDomain(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    domainName: "example.com",
    nameServer: [
      {
        name: "ns-195.awsdns-24.com",
      },
      {
        name: "ns-874.awsdns-45.net",
      },
    ],
    tags: {
      Environment: "test",
    },
  }
);

```
