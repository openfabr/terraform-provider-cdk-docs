# Resource: aws\_auditmanager\_assessment\_delegation

Terraform resource for managing an AWS Audit Manager Assessment Delegation.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.auditmanagerAssessmentDelegation.AuditmanagerAssessmentDelegation(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    assessmentId: "${aws_auditmanager_assessment.example.id}",
    controlSetId: "example",
    roleArn: "${aws_iam_role.example.arn}",
    roleType: "RESOURCE_OWNER",
  }
);

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `assessmentId` - (Required) Identifier for the assessment.
* `controlSetId` - (Required) Assessment control set name. This value is the control set name used during assessment creation (not the AWS-generated ID). The `id` suffix on this attribute has been preserved to be consistent with the underlying AWS API.
* `roleArn` - (Required) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role.
* `roleType` - (Required) Type of customer persona. For assessment delegation, type must always be `resourceOwner`.

The following arguments are optional:

* `comment` - (Optional) Comment describing the delegation request.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `delegationId` - Unique identifier for the delegation.
* `id` - Unique identifier for the resource. This is a comma-separated string containing `assessmentId`, `roleArn`, and `controlSetId`.
* `status` - Status of the delegation.

## Import

Audit Manager Assessment Delegation can be imported using the `id`, e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_auditmanager_assessment_delegation.example abcdef-123456,arn:aws:iam::012345678901:role/example,example
```
