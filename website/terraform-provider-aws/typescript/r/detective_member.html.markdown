# Resource: aws\_detective\_member

Provides a resource to manage an [Amazon Detective Member](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/APIReference/API_CreateMembers.html).

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsDetectiveGraphExample = new aws.detectiveGraph.DetectiveGraph(
  this,
  "example",
  {}
);
const awsDetectiveMemberExample = new aws.detectiveMember.DetectiveMember(

    disableEmailNotification: true,
    emailAddress: "EMAIL",
    graphArn: awsDetectiveGraphExample.id,
    message: "Message of the invitation",
  }
);
