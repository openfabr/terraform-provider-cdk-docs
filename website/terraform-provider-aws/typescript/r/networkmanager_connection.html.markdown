# Resource: aws\_networkmanager\_connection

Creates a connection between two devices.
The devices can be a physical or virtual appliance that connects to a third-party appliance in a VPC, or a physical appliance that connects to another physical appliance in an on-premises network.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.networkmanagerConnection.NetworkmanagerConnection(this, "example", {
  connectedDeviceId: "${aws_networkmanager_device.example2.id}",
  deviceId: "${aws_networkmanager_device.example1.id}",
  globalNetworkId: "${aws_networkmanager_global_network.example.id}",
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `connectedDeviceId` - (Required) The ID of the second device in the connection.
* `connectedLinkId` - (Optional) The ID of the link for the second device.
* `description` - (Optional) A description of the connection.
* `deviceId` - (Required) The ID of the first device in the connection.
* `globalNetworkId` - (Required) The ID of the global network.
* `linkId` - (Optional) The ID of the link for the first device.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value tags for the connection. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the connection.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

`awsNetworkmanagerConnection` can be imported using the connection ARN, e.g.

```console
$ terraform import aws_networkmanager_connection.example arn:aws:networkmanager::123456789012:device/global-network-0d47f6t230mz46dy4/connection-07f6fd08867abc123
```
