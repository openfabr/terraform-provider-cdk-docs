# Resource: aws\_vpc\_endpoint\_service\_allowed\_principal

Provides a resource to allow a principal to discover a VPC endpoint service.

\~> **NOTE on VPC Endpoint Services and VPC Endpoint Service Allowed Principals:** Terraform provides
both a standalone [VPC Endpoint Service Allowed Principal](vpc_endpoint_service_allowed_principal.html) resource
and a VPC Endpoint Service resource with an `allowedPrincipals` attribute. Do not use the same principal ARN in both
a VPC Endpoint Service resource and a VPC Endpoint Service Allowed Principal resource. Doing so will cause a conflict
and will overwrite the association.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const dataAwsCallerIdentityCurrent =
  new aws.dataAwsCallerIdentity.DataAwsCallerIdentity(this, "current", {});
new aws.vpcEndpointServiceAllowedPrincipal.VpcEndpointServiceAllowedPrincipal(
  this,
  "allow_me_to_foo",
  {
    principalArn: dataAwsCallerIdentityCurrent.arn,
    vpcEndpointServiceId: "${aws_vpc_endpoint_service.foo.id}",
  }
);

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `vpcEndpointServiceId` - (Required) The ID of the VPC endpoint service to allow permission.
* `principalArn` - (Required) The ARN of the principal to allow permissions.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the association.
