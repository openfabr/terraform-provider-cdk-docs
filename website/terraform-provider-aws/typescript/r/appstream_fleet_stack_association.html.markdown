## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.

import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsAppstreamFleetExample = new aws.appstreamFleet.AppstreamFleet(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    computeCapacity: {
      desiredInstances: 1,
    },
    imageName: "Amazon-AppStream2-Sample-Image-02-04-2019",
    instanceType: "stream.standard.small",
    name: "NAME",
  }
);
const awsAppstreamStackExample = new aws.appstreamStack.AppstreamStack(
  this,
  "example_1",
  {
    name: "STACK NAME",
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsAppstreamStackExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const awsAppstreamFleetStackAssociationExample =
  new aws.appstreamFleetStackAssociation.AppstreamFleetStackAssociation(
    this,
    "example_2",
    {
      fleetName: awsAppstreamFleetExample.name,
      stackName: awsAppstreamStackExample.name,
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsAppstreamFleetStackAssociationExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
