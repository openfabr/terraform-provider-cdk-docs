# Resource: aws\_lightsail\_instance

Provides a Lightsail Instance. Amazon Lightsail is a service to provide easy virtual private servers
with custom software already setup. See [What is Amazon Lightsail?](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/getting-started/article/what-is-amazon-lightsail)
for more information.

\~> **Note:** Lightsail is currently only supported in a limited number of AWS Regions, please see ["Regions and Availability Zones in Amazon Lightsail"](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/overview/article/understanding-regions-and-availability-zones-in-amazon-lightsail) for more details

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.lightsailInstance.LightsailInstance(this, "gitlab_test", {
  availabilityZone: "us-east-1b",
  blueprintId: "amazon_linux",
  bundleId: "nano_1_0",
  keyPairName: "some_key_name",
  name: "custom_gitlab",
  tags: {
    foo: "bar",
  },
});

```

### Enable Auto Snapshots

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.lightsailInstance.LightsailInstance(this, "test", {
  addOn: {
    snapshotTime: "06:00",
    status: "Enabled",
    type: "AutoSnapshot",
  },
  availabilityZone: "us-east-1b",
  blueprintId: "amazon_linux",
  bundleId: "nano_1_0",
  name: "custom_instance",
  tags: {
    foo: "bar",
  },
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the Lightsail Instance. Names be unique within each AWS Region in your Lightsail account.
* `availabilityZone` - (Required) The Availability Zone in which to create your
  instance (see list below)
* `blueprintId` - (Required) The ID for a virtual private server image. A list of available blueprint IDs can be obtained using the AWS CLI command: `awsLightsailGetBlueprints`
* `bundleId` - (Required) The bundle of specification information (see list below)
* `keyPairName` - (Optional) The name of your key pair. Created in the
  Lightsail console (cannot use `awsKeyPair` at this time)
* `userData` - (Optional) launch script to configure server with additional user data
* `ipAddressType` - (Optional) The IP address type of the Lightsail Instance. Valid Values: `dualstack` | `ipv4`.
* `addOn` - (Optional) The add on configuration for the instance. [Detailed below](#add_on).
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. To create a key-only tag, use an empty string as the value. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

### `addOn`

Defines the add on configuration for the instance. The `addOn` configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `type` - (Required) The add-on type. There is currently only one valid type `autoSnapshot`.
* `snapshotTime` - (Required) The daily time when an automatic snapshot will be created. Must be in HH:00 format, and in an hourly increment and specified in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The snapshot will be automatically created between the time specified and up to 45 minutes after.
* `status` - (Required) The status of the add on. Valid Values: `enabled`, `disabled`.

## Availability Zones

Lightsail currently supports the following Availability Zones (e.g., `usEast1A`):

* `apNortheast1{a,c,d}`
* `apNortheast2{a,c}`
* `apSouth1{a,b}`
* `apSoutheast1{a,b,c}`
* `apSoutheast2{a,b,c}`
* `caCentral1{a,b}`
* `euCentral1{a,b,c}`
* `euWest1{a,b,c}`
* `euWest2{a,b,c}`
* `euWest3{a,b,c}`
* `usEast1{a,b,c,d,e,f}`
* `usEast2{a,b,c}`
* `usWest2{a,b,c}`

## Bundles

Lightsail currently supports the following Bundle IDs (e.g., an instance in `apNortheast1` would use `small20`):

### Prefix

A Bundle ID starts with one of the below size prefixes:

* `nano`
* `micro`
* `small`
* `medium`
* `large`
* `xlarge`
* `2Xlarge`

### Suffix

A Bundle ID ends with one of the following suffixes depending on Availability Zone:

* ap-northeast-1: `20`
* ap-northeast-2: `20`
* ap-south-1: `21`
* ap-southeast-1: `20`
* ap-southeast-2: `22`
* ca-central-1: `20`
* eu-central-1: `20`
* eu-west-1: `20`
* eu-west-2: `20`
* eu-west-3: `20`
* us-east-1: `20`
* us-east-2: `20`
* us-west-2: `20`

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ARN of the Lightsail instance (matches `arn`).
* `arn` - The ARN of the Lightsail instance (matches `id`).
* `createdAt` - The timestamp when the instance was created.
* `cpuCount` - The number of vCPUs the instance has.
* `ramSize` - The amount of RAM in GB on the instance (e.g., 1.0).
* `ipv6Address` - (**Deprecated**) The first IPv6 address of the Lightsail instance. Use `ipv6Addresses` attribute instead.
* `ipv6Addresses` - List of IPv6 addresses for the Lightsail instance.
* `privateIpAddress` - The private IP address of the instance.
* `publicIpAddress` - The public IP address of the instance.
* `isStaticIp` - A Boolean value indicating whether this instance has a static IP assigned to it.
* `username` - The user name for connecting to the instance (e.g., ec2-user).
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

Lightsail Instances can be imported using their name, e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_lightsail_instance.gitlab_test 'custom_gitlab'
```
