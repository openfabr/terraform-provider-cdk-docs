# Resource: aws\_iam\_group\_membership

\~> **WARNING:** Multiple aws\_iam\_group\_membership resources with the same group name will produce inconsistent behavior!

Provides a top level resource to manage IAM Group membership for IAM Users. For
more information on managing IAM Groups or IAM Users, see [IAM Groups][1] or
[IAM Users][2]

\~> **Note:** `awsIamGroupMembership` will conflict with itself if used more than once with the same group. To non-exclusively manage the users in a group, see the
[`awsIamUserGroupMembership` resource][3].

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsIamGroupGroup = new aws.iamGroup.IamGroup(this, "group", {
  name: "test-group",
});
const awsIamUserUserOne = new aws.iamUser.IamUser(this, "user_one", {
  name: "test-user",
});
const awsIamUserUserTwo = new aws.iamUser.IamUser(this, "user_two", {
  name: "test-user-two",
});
new aws.iamGroupMembership.IamGroupMembership(this, "team", {
  group: awsIamGroupGroup.name,
  name: "tf-testing-group-membership",
  users: [awsIamUserUserOne.name, awsIamUserUserTwo.name],
});
