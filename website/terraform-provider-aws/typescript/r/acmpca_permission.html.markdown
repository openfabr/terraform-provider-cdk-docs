# Resource: aws\_acmpca\_permission

Provides a resource to manage an AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authorities Permission.
Currently, this is only required in order to allow the ACM service to automatically renew certificates issued by a PCA.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsAcmpcaCertificateAuthorityExample =
  new aws.acmpcaCertificateAuthority.AcmpcaCertificateAuthority(
    this,
    "example",
    {
      certificateAuthorityConfiguration: {
        keyAlgorithm: "RSA_4096",
        signingAlgorithm: "SHA512WITHRSA",
        subject: {
          commonName: "example.com",
        },
      },
    }
  );
const awsAcmpcaPermissionExample = new aws.acmpcaPermission.AcmpcaPermission(
  this,
  "example_1",
  {
    actions: ["IssueCertificate", "GetCertificate", "ListPermissions"],
    certificateAuthorityArn: awsAcmpcaCertificateAuthorityExample.arn,
    principal: "acm.amazonaws.com",
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsAcmpcaPermissionExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `certificateAuthorityArn` - (Required) ARN of the CA that grants the permissions.
* `actions` - (Required) Actions that the specified AWS service principal can use. These include `issueCertificate`, `getCertificate`, and `listPermissions`. Note that in order for ACM to automatically rotate certificates issued by a PCA, it must be granted permission on all 3 actions, as per the example above.
* `principal` - (Required) AWS service or identity that receives the permission. At this time, the only valid principal is `acmAmazonawsCom`.
* `sourceAccount` - (Optional) ID of the calling account

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `policy` - IAM policy that is associated with the permission.
