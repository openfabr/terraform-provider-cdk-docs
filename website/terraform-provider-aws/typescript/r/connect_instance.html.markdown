!> **WARN:** Amazon Connect enforces a limit of [100 combined instance creation and deletions every 30 days](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-service-limits.html#feature-limits).  For example, if you create 80 instances and delete 20 of them, you must wait 30 days to create or delete another instance.  Use care when creating or deleting instances.
