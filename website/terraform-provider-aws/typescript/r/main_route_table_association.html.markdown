# Resource: aws\_main\_route\_table\_association

Provides a resource for managing the main routing table of a VPC.

\~> **NOTE:** **Do not** use both `awsDefaultRouteTable` to manage a default route table **and** `awsMainRouteTableAssociation` with the same VPC due to possible route conflicts. See [aws\_default\_route\_table][tf-default-route-table] documentation for more details.
For more information, see the Amazon VPC User Guide on [Route Tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html). For information about managing normal route tables in Terraform, see [`awsRouteTable`](/docs/providers/aws/r/route_table.html).

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.mainRouteTableAssociation.MainRouteTableAssociation(this, "a", {
  routeTableId: "${aws_route_table.bar.id}",
  vpcId: "${aws_vpc.foo.id}",
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `vpcId` - (Required) The ID of the VPC whose main route table should be set
* `routeTableId` - (Required) The ID of the Route Table to set as the new
  main route table for the target VPC

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Route Table Association
* `originalRouteTableId` - Used internally, see **Notes** below

## Notes

On VPC creation, the AWS API always creates an initial Main Route Table. This
resource records the ID of that Route Table under `originalRouteTableId`.
The "Delete" action for a `mainRouteTableAssociation` consists of resetting
this original table as the Main Route Table for the VPC. You'll see this
additional Route Table in the AWS console; it must remain intact in order for
the `mainRouteTableAssociation` delete to work properly.
