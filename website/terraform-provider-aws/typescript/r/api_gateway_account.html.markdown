# Resource: aws\_api\_gateway\_account

Provides a settings of an API Gateway Account. Settings is applied region-wide per `provider` block.

\-> **Note:** As there is no API method for deleting account settings or resetting it to defaults, destroying this resource will keep your account settings intact

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsIamRoleCloudwatch = new aws.iamRole.IamRole(this, "cloudwatch", {
  assumeRolePolicy:
    '{\n  "Version": "2012-10-17",\n  "Statement": [\n    {\n      "Sid": "",\n      "Effect": "Allow",\n      "Principal": {\n        "Service": "apigateway.amazonaws.com"\n      },\n      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n',
  name: "api_gateway_cloudwatch_global",
});
const awsIamRolePolicyCloudwatch = new aws.iamRolePolicy.IamRolePolicy(
  this,
  "cloudwatch_1",
  {
    name: "default",
    policy:
      '{\n    "Version": "2012-10-17",\n    "Statement": [\n        {\n            "Effect": "Allow",\n            "Action": [\n                "logs:CreateLogGroup",\n                "logs:CreateLogStream",\n                "logs:DescribeLogGroups",\n                "logs:DescribeLogStreams",\n                "logs:PutLogEvents",\n                "logs:GetLogEvents",\n                "logs:FilterLogEvents"\n            ],\n            "Resource": "*"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n',
    role: awsIamRoleCloudwatch.id,
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsIamRolePolicyCloudwatch.overrideLogicalId("cloudwatch");
new aws.apiGatewayAccount.ApiGatewayAccount(this, "demo", {
  cloudwatchRoleArn: awsIamRoleCloudwatch.arn,
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following argument is supported:

* `cloudwatchRoleArn` - (Optional) ARN of an IAM role for CloudWatch (to allow logging & monitoring). See more [in AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-stage-settings.html#how-to-stage-settings-console). Logging & monitoring can be enabled/disabled and otherwise tuned on the API Gateway Stage level.

## Attributes Reference

The following attribute is exported:

* `throttleSettings` - Account-Level throttle settings. See exported fields below.

`throttleSettings` block exports the following:

* `burstLimit` - Absolute maximum number of times API Gateway allows the API to be called per second (RPS).
* `rateLimit` - Number of times API Gateway allows the API to be called per second on average (RPS).

## Import
