import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.route53RecoverycontrolconfigSafetyRule.Route53RecoverycontrolconfigSafetyRule(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    assertedControls: [
      "${aws_route53recoverycontrolconfig_routing_control.example.arn}",
    ],
    controlPanelArn:
      "arn:aws:route53-recovery-control::313517334327:controlpanel/abd5fbfc052d4844a082dbf400f61da8",
    name: "daisyguttridge",
    ruleConfig: {

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `controlPanelArn` - (Required) ARN of the control panel in which this safety rule will reside.
* `name` - (Required) Name describing the safety rule.
* `ruleConfig` - (Required) Configuration block for safety rule criteria. See below.
* `waitPeriodMs` - (Required) Evaluation period, in milliseconds (ms), during which any request against the target routing controls will fail.

The following arguments are optional:

* `assertedControls` - (Optional) Routing controls that are part of transactions that are evaluated to determine if a request to change a routing control state is allowed.
* `gatingControls` - (Optional) Gating controls for the new gating rule. That is, routing controls that are evaluated by the rule configuration that you specify.
* `targetControls` - (Optional) Routing controls that can only be set or unset if the specified `ruleConfig` evaluates to true for the specified `gatingControls`.

### rule\_config

* `inverted` - (Required) Logical negation of the rule.
* `threshold` - (Required) Number of controls that must be set when you specify an `atleast` type rule.
* `type` - (Required) Rule type. Valid values are `atleast`, `and`, and `or`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - ARN of the safety rule.
* `status` - Status of the safety rule. `pending` when it is being created/updated, `pendingDeletion` when it is being deleted, and `deployed` otherwise.

## Import

Route53 Recovery Control Config Safety Rule can be imported via the safety rule ARN, e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_route53recoverycontrolconfig_safety_rule.myrule arn:aws:route53-recovery-control::313517334327:controlpanel/1bfba17df8684f5dab0467b71424f7e8/safetyrule/3bacc77003364c0f
```
