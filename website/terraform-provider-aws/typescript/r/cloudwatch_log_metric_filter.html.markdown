# Resource: aws\_cloudwatch\_log\_metric\_filter

Provides a CloudWatch Log Metric Filter resource.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsCloudwatchLogGroupDada = new aws.cloudwatchLogGroup.CloudwatchLogGroup(
  this,
  "dada",
  {
    name: "MyApp/access.log",
  }
);
new aws.cloudwatchLogMetricFilter.CloudwatchLogMetricFilter(this, "yada", {
  logGroupName: awsCloudwatchLogGroupDada.name,
  metricTransformation: {
    name: "EventCount",
    namespace: "YourNamespace",
    value: "1",
  },
  name: "MyAppAccessCount",
  pattern: "",
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) A name for the metric filter.
* `pattern` - (Required) A valid [CloudWatch Logs filter pattern](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/FilterAndPatternSyntax.html)
  for extracting metric data out of ingested log events.
* `logGroupName` - (Required) The name of the log group to associate the metric filter with.
* `metricTransformation` - (Required) A block defining collection of information needed to define how metric data gets emitted. See below.

The `metricTransformation` block supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the CloudWatch metric to which the monitored log information should be published (e.g., `errorCount`)
* `namespace` - (Required) The destination namespace of the CloudWatch metric.
* `value` - (Required) What to publish to the metric. For example, if you're counting the occurrences of a particular term like "Error", the value will be "1" for each occurrence. If you're counting the bytes transferred the published value will be the value in the log event.
* `defaultValue` - (Optional) The value to emit when a filter pattern does not match a log event. Conflicts with `dimensions`.
* `dimensions` - (Optional) Map of fields to use as dimensions for the metric. Up to 3 dimensions are allowed. Conflicts with `defaultValue`.
* `unit` - (Optional) The unit to assign to the metric. If you omit this, the unit is set as `none`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The name of the metric filter.

## Import

CloudWatch Log Metric Filter can be imported using the `logGroupName:name`, e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_cloudwatch_log_metric_filter.test /aws/lambda/function:test
```
