# Resource: aws\_iot\_certificate

Creates and manages an AWS IoT certificate.

## Example Usage

### With CSR

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.iotCertificate.IotCertificate(this, "cert", {
  active: true,
  csr: '${file("/my/csr.pem")}',
});

```

### Without CSR

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.iotCertificate.IotCertificate(this, "cert", {
  active: true,
});

```

### From existing certificate without a CA

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.iotCertificate.IotCertificate(this, "cert", {
  active: true,
  certificatePem: '${file("/my/cert.pem")}',
});

```

## Argument Reference

* `active` - (Required)  Boolean flag to indicate if the certificate should be active
* `csr` - (Optional) The certificate signing request. Review
  [CreateCertificateFromCsr](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_CreateCertificateFromCsr.html)
  for more information on generating a certificate from a certificate signing request (CSR).
  If none is specified both the certificate and keys will be generated, review [CreateKeysAndCertificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_CreateKeysAndCertificate.html)
  for more information on generating keys and a certificate.
* `certificatePem` - (Optional) The certificate to be registered. If `caPem` is unspecified, review
  [RegisterCertificateWithoutCA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_RegisterCertificateWithoutCA.html).
  If `caPem` is specified, review
  [RegisterCertificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_RegisterCertificate.html)
  for more information on registering a certificate.
* `caPem` - (Optional) The CA certificate for the certificate to be registered. If this is set, the CA needs to be registered with AWS IoT beforehand.

## Attributes Reference

* `id` - The internal ID assigned to this certificate.
* `arn` - The ARN of the created certificate.
* `certificatePem` - The certificate data, in PEM format.
