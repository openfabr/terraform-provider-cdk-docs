  Provides an Elastic Load Balancer Attachment resource.

# Resource: aws\_elb\_attachment

Attaches an EC2 instance to an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). For attaching resources with Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB), see the [`awsLbTargetGroupAttachment` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/lb_target_group_attachment.html).

\~> **NOTE on ELB Instances and ELB Attachments:** Terraform currently provides
both a standalone ELB Attachment resource (describing an instance attached to
an ELB), and an [Elastic Load Balancer resource](elb.html) with
`instances` defined in-line. At this time you cannot use an ELB with in-line
instances in conjunction with an ELB Attachment resource. Doing so will cause a
conflict and will overwrite attachments.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.elbAttachment.ElbAttachment(this, "baz", {
  elb: "${aws_elb.bar.id}",
  instance: "${aws_instance.foo.id}",
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `elb` - (Required) The name of the ELB.
* `instance` - (Required) Instance ID to place in the ELB pool.
