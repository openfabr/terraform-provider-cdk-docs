# Resource: aws\_glue\_trigger

Manages a Glue Trigger resource.

## Example Usage

### Conditional Trigger

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.glueTrigger.GlueTrigger(this, "example", {
  actions: [
    {
      jobName: "${aws_glue_job.example1.name}",
    },
  ],
  name: "example",
  predicate: {
    conditions: [
      {
        jobName: "${aws_glue_job.example2.name}",
        state: "SUCCEEDED",
      },
    ],
  },
  type: "CONDITIONAL",
});

```

### On-Demand Trigger

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.glueTrigger.GlueTrigger(this, "example", {
  actions: [
    {
      jobName: "${aws_glue_job.example.name}",
    },
  ],
  name: "example",
  type: "ON_DEMAND",
});

```

### Scheduled Trigger

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.glueTrigger.GlueTrigger(this, "example", {
  actions: [
    {
      jobName: "${aws_glue_job.example.name}",
    },
  ],
  name: "example",
  schedule: "cron(15 12 * * ? *)",
  type: "SCHEDULED",
});

```

### Conditional Trigger with Crawler Action

**Note:** Triggers can have both a crawler action and a crawler condition, just no example provided.

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.glueTrigger.GlueTrigger(this, "example", {
  actions: [
    {
      crawlerName: "${aws_glue_crawler.example1.name}",
    },
  ],
  name: "example",
  predicate: {
    conditions: [
      {
        jobName: "${aws_glue_job.example2.name}",
        state: "SUCCEEDED",
      },
    ],
  },
  type: "CONDITIONAL",
});

```

### Conditional Trigger with Crawler Condition

**Note:** Triggers can have both a crawler action and a crawler condition, just no example provided.

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.glueTrigger.GlueTrigger(this, "example", {
  actions: [
    {
      jobName: "${aws_glue_job.example1.name}",
    },
  ],
  name: "example",
  predicate: {
    conditions: [
      {
        crawlState: "SUCCEEDED",
        crawlerName: "${aws_glue_crawler.example2.name}",
      },
    ],
  },
  type: "CONDITIONAL",
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `actions` – (Required) List of actions initiated by this trigger when it fires. See [Actions](#actions) Below.
* `description` – (Optional) A description of the new trigger.
* `enabled` – (Optional) Start the trigger. Defaults to `true`.
* `name` – (Required) The name of the trigger.
* `predicate` – (Optional) A predicate to specify when the new trigger should fire. Required when trigger type is `conditional`. See [Predicate](#predicate) Below.
* `schedule` – (Optional) A cron expression used to specify the schedule. [Time-Based Schedules for Jobs and Crawlers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/monitor-data-warehouse-schedule.html)
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
* `startOnCreation` – (Optional) Set to true to start `scheduled` and `conditional` triggers when created. True is not supported for `onDemand` triggers.
* `type` – (Required) The type of trigger. Valid values are `conditional`, `event`, `onDemand`, and `scheduled`.
* `workflowName` - (Optional) A workflow to which the trigger should be associated to. Every workflow graph (DAG) needs a starting trigger (`onDemand` or `scheduled` type) and can contain multiple additional `conditional` triggers.
* `eventBatchingCondition` - (Optional) Batch condition that must be met (specified number of events received or batch time window expired) before EventBridge event trigger fires. See [Event Batching Condition](#event-batching-condition).

### Actions

* `arguments` - (Optional) Arguments to be passed to the job. You can specify arguments here that your own job-execution script consumes, as well as arguments that AWS Glue itself consumes.
* `crawlerName` - (Optional) The name of the crawler to be executed. Conflicts with `jobName`.
* `jobName` - (Optional) The name of a job to be executed. Conflicts with `crawlerName`.
* `timeout` - (Optional) The job run timeout in minutes. It overrides the timeout value of the job.
* `securityConfiguration` - (Optional) The name of the Security Configuration structure to be used with this action.
* `notificationProperty` - (Optional) Specifies configuration properties of a job run notification. See [Notification Property](#notification-property) details below.

#### Notification Property

* `notifyDelayAfter` - (Optional) After a job run starts, the number of minutes to wait before sending a job run delay notification.

### Predicate

* `conditions` - (Required) A list of the conditions that determine when the trigger will fire. See [Conditions](#conditions).
* `logical` - (Optional) How to handle multiple conditions. Defaults to `and`. Valid values are `and` or `any`.

#### Conditions

* `jobName` - (Optional) The name of the job to watch. If this is specified, `state` must also be specified. Conflicts with `crawlerName`.
* `state` - (Optional) The condition job state. Currently, the values supported are `succeeded`, `stopped`, `timeout` and `failed`. If this is specified, `jobName` must also be specified. Conflicts with `crawlerState`.
* `crawlerName` - (Optional) The name of the crawler to watch. If this is specified, `crawlState` must also be specified. Conflicts with `jobName`.
* `crawlState` - (Optional) The condition crawl state. Currently, the values supported are `running`, `succeeded`, `cancelled`, and `failed`. If this is specified, `crawlerName` must also be specified. Conflicts with `state`.
* `logicalOperator` - (Optional) A logical operator. Defaults to `equals`.

### Event Batching Condition

* `batchSize` - (Required)Number of events that must be received from Amazon EventBridge before EventBridge  event trigger fires.
* `batchWindow` - (Optional) Window of time in seconds after which EventBridge event trigger fires. Window starts when first event is received. Default value is `900`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of Glue Trigger
* `id` - Trigger name
* `state` - The current state of the trigger.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

* `create` - (Default `5M`)
* `delete` - (Default `5M`)

## Import

Glue Triggers can be imported using `name`, e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_glue_trigger.MyTrigger MyTrigger
```
