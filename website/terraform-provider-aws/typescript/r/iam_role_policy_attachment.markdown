# Resource: aws\_iam\_role\_policy\_attachment

Attaches a Managed IAM Policy to an IAM role

\~> **NOTE:** The usage of this resource conflicts with the `awsIamPolicyAttachment` resource and will permanently show a difference if both are defined.

\~> **NOTE:** For a given role, this resource is incompatible with using the [`awsIamRole` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/iam_role.html) `managedPolicyArns` argument. When using that argument and this resource, both will attempt to manage the role's managed policy attachments and Terraform will show a permanent difference.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsIamPolicyPolicy = new aws.iamPolicy.IamPolicy(this, "policy", {
  description: "A test policy",
  name: "test-policy",
  policy:
    '{\n  "Version": "2012-10-17",\n  "Statement": [\n    {\n      "Action": [\n        "ec2:Describe*"\n      ],\n      "Effect": "Allow",\n      "Resource": "*"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n',
});
const awsIamRoleRole = new aws.iamRole.IamRole(this, "role", {
  assumeRolePolicy:
    '{\n  "Version": "2012-10-17",\n  "Statement": [\n    {\n      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",\n      "Principal": {\n        "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"\n      },\n      "Effect": "Allow",\n      "Sid": ""\n    }\n  ]\n}\n',
  name: "test-role",
});
new aws.iamRolePolicyAttachment.IamRolePolicyAttachment(this, "test-attach", {
  policyArn: awsIamPolicyPolicy.arn,
  role: awsIamRoleRole.name,
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `role`  (Required) - The name of the IAM role to which the policy should be applied
* `policyArn` (Required) - The ARN of the policy you want to apply

## Attributes Reference

No additional attributes are exported.

## Import

IAM role policy attachments can be imported using the role name and policy arn separated by `/`.
