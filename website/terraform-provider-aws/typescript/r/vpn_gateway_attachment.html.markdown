# Resource: aws\_vpn\_gateway\_attachment

Provides a Virtual Private Gateway attachment resource, allowing for an existing
hardware VPN gateway to be attached and/or detached from a VPC.

\-> **Note:** The [`awsVpnGateway`](vpn_gateway.html)
resource can also automatically attach the Virtual Private Gateway it creates
to an existing VPC by setting the [`vpcId`](vpn_gateway.html#vpc_id) attribute accordingly.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsVpcNetwork = new aws.vpc.Vpc(this, "network", {
  cidrBlock: "10.0.0.0/16",
});
const awsVpnGatewayVpn = new aws.vpnGateway.VpnGateway(this, "vpn", {
  tags: {
    Name: "example-vpn-gateway",
  },
});
new aws.vpnGatewayAttachment.VpnGatewayAttachment(this, "vpn_attachment", {
  vpcId: awsVpcNetwork.id,
  vpnGatewayId: awsVpnGatewayVpn.id,
});

```
