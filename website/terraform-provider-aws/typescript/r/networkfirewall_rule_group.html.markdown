# Resource: aws\_networkfirewall\_rule\_group

Provides an AWS Network Firewall Rule Group Resource

## Example Usage

### Stateful Inspection for denying access to a domain

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.networkfirewallRuleGroup.NetworkfirewallRuleGroup(this, "example", {
  capacity: 100,
  name: "example",
  ruleGroup: {
    rulesSource: {
      rulesSourceList: {
        generatedRulesType: "DENYLIST",
        targetTypes: ["HTTP_HOST"],
        targets: ["test.example.com"],
      },
    },
  },
  tags: {
    Tag1: "Value1",
    Tag2: "Value2",
  },
  type: "STATEFUL",
});

```

### Stateful Inspection for permitting packets from a source IP address

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const ips = ["1.1.1.1/32", "1.0.0.1/32"];
const awsNetworkfirewallRuleGroupExample =
  new aws.networkfirewallRuleGroup.NetworkfirewallRuleGroup(this, "example", {

      },
    },
    tags: {
      Name: "permit HTTP from source",
    },
    type: "STATEFUL",
  });
/*In most cases loops should be handled in the programming language context and 
not inside of the Terraform context. If you are looping over something external, e.g. a variable or a file input
you should consider using a for loop. If you are looping over something only known to Terraform, e.g. a result of a data source
you need to keep this like it is.*/
awsNetworkfirewallRuleGroupExample.addOverride(
  "rule_group.0.rules_source.0.stateful_rule",
  {
    for_each: ips,
    content: [
      {

For a stateless rule group, the capacity required is the sum of the capacity requirements of the individual rules. For a stateful rule group, the minimum capacity required is the number of individual rules.
