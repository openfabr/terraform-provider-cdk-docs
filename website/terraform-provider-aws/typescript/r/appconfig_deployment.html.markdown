## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.appconfigDeployment.AppconfigDeployment(this, "example", {
  applicationId: "${aws_appconfig_application.example.id}",
  configurationProfileId:
    "${aws_appconfig_configuration_profile.example.configuration_profile_id}",
  configurationVersion:
    "${aws_appconfig_hosted_configuration_version.example.version_number}",
  deploymentStrategyId: "${aws_appconfig_deployment_strategy.example.id}",
  description: "My example deployment",
  environmentId: "${aws_appconfig_environment.example.environment_id}",
  tags: {
    Type: "AppConfig Deployment",
  },
});

```

* `configurationVersion` - (Required, Forces new resource) Configuration version to deploy. Can be at most 1024 characters.
* `deploymentStrategyId` - (Required, Forces new resource) Deployment strategy ID or name of a predefined deployment strategy. See [Predefined Deployment Strategies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/appconfig-creating-deployment-strategy.html#appconfig-creating-deployment-strategy-predefined) for more details.
