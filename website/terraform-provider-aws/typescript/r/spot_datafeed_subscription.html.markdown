# Resource: aws\_spot\_datafeed\_subscription

\-> **Note:** There is only a single subscription allowed per account.

To help you understand the charges for your Spot instances, Amazon EC2 provides a data feed that describes your Spot instance usage and pricing.
This data feed is sent to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify when you subscribe to the data feed.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsS3BucketDefault = new aws.s3Bucket.S3Bucket(this, "default", {
  bucket: "tf-spot-datafeed",
});
const awsSpotDatafeedSubscriptionDefault =
  new aws.spotDatafeedSubscription.SpotDatafeedSubscription(this, "default_1", {
    bucket: awsS3BucketDefault.bucket,
    prefix: "my_subdirectory",
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsSpotDatafeedSubscriptionDefault.overrideLogicalId("default");

```

## Argument Reference

* `bucket` - (Required) The Amazon S3 bucket in which to store the Spot instance data feed.
* `prefix` - (Optional) Path of folder inside bucket to place spot pricing data.
