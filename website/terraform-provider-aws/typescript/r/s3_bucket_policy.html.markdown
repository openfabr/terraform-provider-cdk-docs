# Resource: aws\_s3\_bucket\_policy

Attaches a policy to an S3 bucket resource.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsS3BucketExample = new aws.s3Bucket.S3Bucket(this, "example", {
  bucket: "my-tf-test-bucket",
});
const dataAwsIamPolicyDocumentAllowAccessFromAnotherAccount =
  new aws.dataAwsIamPolicyDocument.DataAwsIamPolicyDocument(
    this,
    "allow_access_from_another_account",
    {
      statement: [
        {
          actions: ["s3:GetObject", "s3:ListBucket"],
          principals: [
            {
              identifiers: ["123456789012"],
              type: "AWS",
            },
          ],
          resources: [
            awsS3BucketExample.arn,
            `\${${awsS3BucketExample.arn}}/*`,
          ],
        },
      ],
    }
  );
const awsS3BucketPolicyAllowAccessFromAnotherAccount =
  new aws.s3BucketPolicy.S3BucketPolicy(
    this,
    "allow_access_from_another_account_2",
    {
      bucket: awsS3BucketExample.id,
      policy: dataAwsIamPolicyDocumentAllowAccessFromAnotherAccount.json,
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsS3BucketPolicyAllowAccessFromAnotherAccount.overrideLogicalId(
  "allow_access_from_another_account"
);

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `bucket` - (Required) The name of the bucket to which to apply the policy.
* `policy` - (Required) The text of the policy. Although this is a bucket policy rather than an IAM policy, the [`awsIamPolicyDocument`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/data-sources/iam_policy_document) data source may be used, so long as it specifies a principal. For more information about building AWS IAM policy documents with Terraform, see the [AWS IAM Policy Document Guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/aws/iam-policy). Note: Bucket policies are limited to 20 KB in size.

## Attributes Reference

No additional attributes are exported.

## Import

S3 bucket policies can be imported using the bucket name, e.g.,

```console
$ terraform import aws_s3_bucket_policy.allow_access_from_another_account my-tf-test-bucket
```
