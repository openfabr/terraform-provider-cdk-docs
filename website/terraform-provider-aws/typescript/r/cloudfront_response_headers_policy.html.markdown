# Resource: aws\_cloudfront\_response\_headers\_policy

Provides a CloudFront response headers policy resource.
A response headers policy contains information about a set of HTTP response headers and their values.
After you create a response headers policy, you can use its ID to attach it to one or more cache behaviors in a CloudFront distribution.
When it’s attached to a cache behavior, CloudFront adds the headers in the policy to every response that it sends for requests that match the cache behavior.

## Example Usage

The example below creates a CloudFront response headers policy.

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.cloudfrontResponseHeadersPolicy.CloudfrontResponseHeadersPolicy(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    comment: "test comment",
    corsConfig: {
      accessControlAllowCredentials: true,
      accessControlAllowHeaders: {
        items: ["test"],
      },
      accessControlAllowMethods: {
        items: ["GET"],
      },
      accessControlAllowOrigins: {
        items: ["test.example.comtest"],
      },
      originOverride: true,
    },
    name: "example-policy",
  }
);

```

The example below creates a CloudFront response headers policy with a custom headers config.

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.cloudfrontResponseHeadersPolicy.CloudfrontResponseHeadersPolicy(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    customHeadersConfig: {
      items: [
        {
          header: "X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies",
          override: true,
          value: "none",
        },
        {
          header: "X-Test",
          override: true,
          value: "none",
        },
      ],
    },
    name: "example-headers-policy",
  }
);

```

The example below creates a CloudFront response headers policy with a custom headers config and server timing headers config.

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.cloudfrontResponseHeadersPolicy.CloudfrontResponseHeadersPolicy(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    customHeadersConfig: {
      items: [
        {
          header: "X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies",
          override: true,
          value: "none",
        },
      ],
    },
    name: "example-headers-policy",
    serverTimingHeadersConfig: {
      enabled: true,
      samplingRate: 50,
    },
  }
);

```
