# Terraform AWS Provider Version 2 Upgrade Guide

Version 2.0.0 of the AWS provider for Terraform is a major release and includes some changes that you will need to consider when upgrading. This guide is intended to help with that process and focuses only on changes from version 1.60.0 to version 2.0.0.

Most of the changes outlined in this guide have been previously marked as deprecated in the Terraform plan/apply output throughout previous provider releases. These changes, such as deprecation notices, can always be found in the [Terraform AWS Provider CHANGELOG](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## Provider Version Configuration

\-> Before upgrading to version 2.0.0 or later, it is recommended to upgrade to the most recent 1.X version of the provider (version 1.60.0) and ensure that your environment successfully runs [`terraformPlan`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html) without unexpected changes or deprecation notices.

We recommend using [version constraints when configuring Terraform providers](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html#provider-versions). If you are following that recommendation, update the version constraints in your Terraform configuration and run [`terraformInit`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/init.html) to download the new version.

Update to latest 1.X version:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.provider.AwsProvider(this, "aws", {});

```

Update to latest 2.X version:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.provider.AwsProvider(this, "aws", {});

```

## Provider: Configuration

### skip\_requesting\_account\_id Argument Now Required to Skip Account ID Lookup Errors

If the provider is unable to determine the AWS account ID from a provider assume role configuration or the STS GetCallerIdentity call used to verify the credentials (if `skipCredentialsValidation =False`), it will attempt to lookup the AWS account ID via EC2 metadata, IAM GetUser, IAM ListRoles, and STS GetCallerIdentity. Previously, the provider would silently allow the failure of all the above methods.

The provider will now return an error to ensure operators understand the implications of the missing AWS account ID in the provider.

If necessary, the AWS account ID lookup logic can be skipped via:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.provider.AwsProvider(this, "aws", {
  skipRequestingAccountId: true,
});

```

## Data Source: aws\_ami

### owners Argument Now Required

The `owners` argument is now required. Specifying `ownerId` or `ownerAlias` under `filter` does not satisfy this requirement.

## Data Source: aws\_ami\_ids

### owners Argument Now Required

The `owners` argument is now required. Specifying `ownerId` or `ownerAlias` under `filter` does not satisfy this requirement.

## Data Source: aws\_iam\_role

### assume\_role\_policy\_document Attribute Removal

Switch your attribute references to the `assumeRolePolicy` attribute instead.

### role\_id Attribute Removal

Switch your attribute references to the `uniqueId` attribute instead.

### role\_name Argument Removal

Switch your Terraform configuration to the `name` argument instead.

## Data Source: aws\_kms\_secret

### Data Source Removal and Migrating to aws\_kms\_secrets Data Source

The implementation of the `awsKmsSecret` data source, prior to Terraform AWS provider version 2.0.0, used dynamic attribute behavior which is not supported with Terraform 0.12 and beyond (full details available in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/5144)).

Terraform configuration migration steps:

* Change the data source type from `awsKmsSecret` to `awsKmsSecrets`
* Change any attribute reference (e.g., `"${dataAwsKmsSecretExampleAttribute}"`) from `attribute` to `plaintext["attribute"]`

As an example, lets take the below sample configuration and migrate it.

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const dataAwsKmsSecretExample = new aws.dataAwsKmsSecret.DataAwsKmsSecret(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    secret: [
      {
        name: "master_password",
        payload: "AQEC...",
      },
      {
        name: "master_username",
        payload: "AQEC...",
      },
    ],
  }
);
const awsRdsClusterExample = new aws.rdsCluster.RdsCluster(this, "example_1", {
  masterPassword: dataAwsKmsSecretExample.masterPassword,
  masterUsername: dataAwsKmsSecretExample.masterUsername,
});
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsRdsClusterExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

Notice that the `awsKmsSecret` data source previously was taking the two `secret` configuration block `name` arguments and generating those as attribute names (`masterPassword` and `masterUsername` in this case). To remove the incompatible behavior, this updated version of the data source provides the decrypted value of each of those `secret` configuration block `name` arguments within a map attribute named `plaintext`.

Updating the sample configuration from above:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const dataAwsKmsSecretsExample = new aws.dataAwsKmsSecrets.DataAwsKmsSecrets(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    secret: [
      {
        name: "master_password",
        payload: "AQEC...",
      },
      {
        name: "master_username",
        payload: "AQEC...",
      },
    ],
  }
);
const awsRdsClusterExample = new aws.rdsCluster.RdsCluster(this, "example_1", {
  masterPassword: `\${${dataAwsKmsSecretsExample.plaintext.fqn}["master_password"]}`,
  masterUsername: `\${${dataAwsKmsSecretsExample.plaintext.fqn}["master_username"]}`,
});
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsRdsClusterExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

## Data Source: aws\_lambda\_function

### arn and qualified\_arn Attribute Behavior Changes

The `arn` attribute now always returns the unqualified (no `:qualifier` or `:version` suffix) ARN value and the `qualifiedArn` attribute now always returns the qualified (includes `:qualifier` or `:version` suffix) ARN value. Previously by default, the `arn` attribute included `:$latest` suffix when not setting the optional `qualifier` argument, which was not compatible with many other resources. To restore the previous default behavior, set the `qualifier` argument to `$latest` and reference the `qualifiedArn` attribute.

## Data Source: aws\_region

### current Argument Removal

Simply remove `current =True` from your Terraform configuration. The data source defaults to the current provider region if no other filtering is enabled.

## Resource: aws\_api\_gateway\_api\_key

### stage\_key Argument Removal

Since the API Gateway usage plans feature was launched on August 11, 2016, usage plans are now required to associate an API key with an API stage. To migrate your Terraform configuration, the AWS provider implements support for usage plans with the following resources:

* [`awsApiGatewayUsagePlan`](/docs/providers/aws/r/api_gateway_usage_plan.html)
* [`awsApiGatewayUsagePlanKey`](/docs/providers/aws/r/api_gateway_usage_plan_key.html)

For example, given this previous configuration:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsApiGatewayRestApiExample = new aws.apiGatewayRestApi.ApiGatewayRestApi(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    name: "example",
  }
);
const awsApiGatewayDeploymentExample =
  new aws.apiGatewayDeployment.ApiGatewayDeployment(this, "example_1", {
    restApiId: awsApiGatewayRestApiExample.id,
    stageName: "example",
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsApiGatewayDeploymentExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const awsApiGatewayApiKeyExample = new aws.apiGatewayApiKey.ApiGatewayApiKey(
  this,
  "example_2",
  {
    name: "example",
    stage_key: [
      {
        rest_api_id: awsApiGatewayRestApiExample.id,
        stage_name: awsApiGatewayDeploymentExample.stageName,
      },
    ],
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsApiGatewayApiKeyExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

An updated configuration:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsApiGatewayApiKeyExample = new aws.apiGatewayApiKey.ApiGatewayApiKey(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    name: "example",
  }
);
const awsApiGatewayRestApiExample = new aws.apiGatewayRestApi.ApiGatewayRestApi(
  this,
  "example_1",
  {
    name: "example",
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsApiGatewayRestApiExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const awsApiGatewayDeploymentExample =
  new aws.apiGatewayDeployment.ApiGatewayDeployment(this, "example_2", {
    restApiId: awsApiGatewayRestApiExample.id,
    stageName: "example",
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsApiGatewayDeploymentExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const awsApiGatewayUsagePlanExample =
  new aws.apiGatewayUsagePlan.ApiGatewayUsagePlan(this, "example_3", {
    apiStages: [
      {
        apiId: awsApiGatewayRestApiExample.id,
        stage: awsApiGatewayDeploymentExample.stageName,
      },
    ],
    name: "example",
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsApiGatewayUsagePlanExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const awsApiGatewayUsagePlanKeyExample =
  new aws.apiGatewayUsagePlanKey.ApiGatewayUsagePlanKey(this, "example_4", {
    keyId: awsApiGatewayApiKeyExample.id,
    keyType: "API_KEY",
    usagePlanId: awsApiGatewayUsagePlanExample.id,
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsApiGatewayUsagePlanKeyExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

## Resource: aws\_api\_gateway\_integration

### request\_parameters\_in\_json Argument Removal

import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.apiGatewayIntegration.ApiGatewayIntegration(this, "example", {
  requestParameters: {
    "integration.request.header.X-Authorization": "'static'",
  },
});

```

## Resource: aws\_api\_gateway\_integration\_response

### response\_parameters\_in\_json Argument Removal

  {
    response_parameters_in_json:
      '{\n    "method.response.header.Content-Type": "integration.response.body.type"\n}\n',
  }
);

```

An updated configuration:

```typescript

  responseParameters: {
    "method.response.header.Content-Type": true,
  },
});

```

## Resource: aws\_appautoscaling\_policy

### Argument Removals

The following arguments have been moved into a nested argument named `stepScalingPolicyConfiguration`:

* `adjustmentType`
* `cooldown`
* `metricAggregationType`
* `minAdjustmentMagnitude`
* `stepAdjustment`

For example, given this previous configuration:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.appautoscalingPolicy.AppautoscalingPolicy(this, "example", {
  adjustment_type: "ChangeInCapacity",
  cooldown: 60,
  metric_aggregation_type: "Maximum",
  step_adjustment: [
    {
      metric_interval_upper_bound: 0,
      scaling_adjustment: -1,
    },
  ],
});

```

An updated configuration:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.appautoscalingPolicy.AppautoscalingPolicy(this, "example", {
  stepScalingPolicyConfiguration: {
    adjustmentType: "ChangeInCapacity",
    cooldown: 60,
    metricAggregationType: "Maximum",
    stepAdjustment: [
      {
        metricIntervalUpperBound: 0,
        scalingAdjustment: -1,
      },
    ],
  },
});

```

## Resource: aws\_autoscaling\_policy

### min\_adjustment\_step Argument Removal

Switch your Terraform configuration to the `minAdjustmentMagnitude` argument instead.

For example, given this previous configuration:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.autoscalingPolicy.AutoscalingPolicy(this, "example", {
  min_adjustment_step: 2,
});

```

An updated configuration:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.autoscalingPolicy.AutoscalingPolicy(this, "example", {
  minAdjustmentMagnitude: 2,
});

```

## Resource: aws\_batch\_compute\_environment

### ecc\_cluster\_arn Attribute Removal

Switch your attribute references to the `ecsClusterArn` attribute instead.

## Resource: aws\_cloudfront\_distribution

### cache\_behavior Argument Removal

Switch your Terraform configuration to the `orderedCacheBehavior` argument instead. It behaves similar to the previous `cacheBehavior` argument, however the ordering of the configurations in Terraform is now reflected in the distribution where previously it was indeterminate.

For example, given this previous configuration:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.cloudfrontDistribution.CloudfrontDistribution(this, "example", {
  cache_behavior: [{}, {}],
});

```

An updated configuration:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.cloudfrontDistribution.CloudfrontDistribution(this, "example", {
  orderedCacheBehavior: [{}, {}],
});

```

## Resource: aws\_cognito\_user\_pool

### email\_verification\_subject Argument Now Conflicts With verification\_message\_template Configuration Block email\_subject Argument

Choose one argument or the other. These arguments update the same underlying information in Cognito and the selection is indeterminate if differing values are provided.

### email\_verification\_message Argument Now Conflicts With verification\_message\_template Configuration Block email\_message Argument

Choose one argument or the other. These arguments update the same underlying information in Cognito and the selection is indeterminate if differing values are provided.

### sms\_verification\_message Argument Now Conflicts With verification\_message\_template Configuration Block sms\_message Argument

Choose one argument or the other. These arguments update the same underlying information in Cognito and the selection is indeterminate if differing values are provided.

## Resource: aws\_dx\_lag

### number\_of\_connections Argument Removal

Default connections have been removed as part of LAG creation. To migrate your Terraform configuration, the AWS provider implements the following resources:

* [`awsDxConnection`](/docs/providers/aws/r/dx_connection.html)
* [`awsDxConnectionAssociation`](/docs/providers/aws/r/dx_connection_association.html)

For example, given this previous configuration:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.dxLag.DxLag(this, "example", {
  connectionsBandwidth: "1Gbps",
  location: "EqSe2-EQ",
  name: "example",
  number_of_connections: 1,
});

```

An updated configuration:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const awsDxConnectionExample = new aws.dxConnection.DxConnection(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    bandwidth: "1Gbps",
    location: "EqSe2-EQ",
    name: "example",
  }
);
const awsDxLagExample = new aws.dxLag.DxLag(this, "example_1", {
  connectionsBandwidth: "1Gbps",
  location: "EqSe2-EQ",
  name: "example",
});
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsDxLagExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const awsDxConnectionAssociationExample =
  new aws.dxConnectionAssociation.DxConnectionAssociation(this, "example_2", {
    connectionId: awsDxConnectionExample.id,
    lagId: awsDxLagExample.id,
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
awsDxConnectionAssociationExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

## Resource: aws\_ecs\_service

### placement\_strategy Argument Removal

Switch your Terraform configuration to the `orderedPlacementStrategy` argument instead. It behaves similar to the previous `placementStrategy` argument, however the ordering of the configurations in Terraform is now reflected in the distribution where previously it was indeterminate.

For example, given this previous configuration:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.ecsService.EcsService(this, "example", {
  placement_strategy: [{}, {}],
});

```

An updated configuration:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.ecsService.EcsService(this, "example", {
  orderedPlacementStrategy: [{}, {}],
});

```

## Resource: aws\_efs\_file\_system

### reference\_name Argument Removal

Switch your Terraform configuration to the `creationToken` argument instead.

For example, given this previous configuration:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.efsFileSystem.EfsFileSystem(this, "example", {
  reference_name: "example",
});

```

An updated configuration:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.efsFileSystem.EfsFileSystem(this, "example", {
  creationToken: "example",
});

```

## Resource: aws\_elasticache\_cluster

### availability\_zones Argument Removal

Switch your Terraform configuration to the `preferredAvailabilityZones` argument instead. The argument is still optional and the API will continue to automatically choose Availability Zones for nodes if not specified. The new argument will also continue to match the APIs required behavior that the length of the list must be the same as `numCacheNodes`.

For example, given this previous configuration:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.elasticacheCluster.ElasticacheCluster(this, "example", {
  availability_zones: ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b"],
});

```

An updated configuration:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.elasticacheCluster.ElasticacheCluster(this, "example", {
  preferredAvailabilityZones: ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b"],
});

```

## Resource: aws\_iam\_user\_login\_profile

### Import Now Required For Existing Infrastructure

When attempting to bring existing IAM User Login Profiles under Terraform management, `terraformImport` is now required. See the [`awsIamUserLoginProfile` resource documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/iam_user_login_profile.html) for more information.

## Resource: aws\_instance

### network\_interface\_id Attribute Removal

Switch your attribute references to the `primaryNetworkInterfaceId` attribute instead.

## Resource: aws\_lambda\_function

### reserved\_concurrent\_executions Argument Behavior Change

Setting `reservedConcurrentExecutions` to `0` will now disable Lambda Function invocations, causing downtime for the Lambda Function.

Previously `reservedConcurrentExecutions` accepted `0` and below for unreserved concurrency, which means it was not previously possible to disable invocations. The argument now differentiates between a new value for unreserved concurrency (`1`) and disabling Lambda invocations (`0`). If previously configuring this value to `0` for unreserved concurrency, update the configured value to `1` or the resource will disable Lambda Function invocations on update. If previously unconfigured, the argument does not require any changes.

See the [Lambda User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/concurrent-executions.html) for more information about concurrency.

## Resource: aws\_lambda\_layer\_version

### arn and layer\_arn Attribute Value Swap

Switch your `arn` attribute references to the `layerArn` attribute instead and vice-versa.

## Resource: aws\_network\_acl

### subnet\_id Argument Removal

Switch your Terraform configuration to the `subnetIds` argument instead.

For example, given this previous configuration:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.networkAcl.NetworkAcl(this, "example", {
  subnet_id: "subnet-12345678",
});

```

An updated configuration:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.networkAcl.NetworkAcl(this, "example", {
  subnetIds: ["subnet-12345678"],
});

```

## Resource: aws\_redshift\_cluster

### Argument Removals

The following arguments have been moved into a nested argument named `logging`:

* `bucketName`
* `enableLogging` (also renamed to just `enable`)
* `s3KeyPrefix`

For example, given this previous configuration:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.redshiftCluster.RedshiftCluster(this, "example", {
  bucket_name: "example",
  enable_logging: true,
  s3_key_prefix: "example",
});

```

An updated configuration:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.redshiftCluster.RedshiftCluster(this, "example", {
  logging: {
    bucketName: "example",
    enable: true,
    s3KeyPrefix: "example",
  },
});

```

## Resource: aws\_route\_table

### Import Change

Previously, importing this resource resulted in an `awsRoute` resource for each route, in
addition to the `awsRouteTable`, in the Terraform state. Support for importing `awsRoute` resources has been added and importing this resource only adds the `awsRouteTable`
resource, with in-line routes, to the state.

## Resource: aws\_route53\_record

### allow\_overwrite Default Value Change

The resource now requires existing Route 53 Records to be imported into the Terraform state for management unless the `allowOverwrite` argument is enabled.

For example, if the `wwwExampleCom` Route 53 Record in the `exampleCom` Route 53 Hosted Zone existed previously and this new Terraform configuration was introduced:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.route53Record.Route53Record(this, "www", {
  name: "www.example.com",
});

```

During resource creation in version 1.X and prior, it would silently perform an `upsert` changeset to the existing Route 53 Record and not report back an error. In version 2.0.0 of the Terraform AWS Provider, the resource now performs a `create` changeset, which will error for existing Route 53 Records.

The `allowOverwrite` argument provides a workaround to keep the old behavior, but most existing workflows should be updated to perform a `terraformImport` command like the following instead:

```console
$ terraform import aws_route53_record.www ZONEID_www.example.com_TYPE
```

More information can be found in the [`awsRoute53Record` resource documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/route53_record.html#import).

## Resource: aws\_route53\_zone

### vpc\_id and vpc\_region Argument Removal

Switch your Terraform configuration to `vpc` configuration block(s) instead.

For example, given this previous configuration:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.route53Zone.Route53Zone(this, "example", {
  vpc_id: "...",
});

```

An updated configuration:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.route53Zone.Route53Zone(this, "example", {
  vpc: [
    {
      vpcId: "...",
    },
  ],
});

```

## Resource: aws\_wafregional\_byte\_match\_set

### byte\_match\_tuple Argument Removal

Switch your Terraform configuration to the `byteMatchTuples` argument instead.

For example, given this previous configuration:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.wafregionalByteMatchSet.WafregionalByteMatchSet(this, "example", {
  byte_match_tuple: [{}, {}],
});

```

An updated configuration:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.wafregionalByteMatchSet.WafregionalByteMatchSet(this, "example", {
  byteMatchTuples: [{}, {}],
});

```
