# Data Source: awsLb

\~> **Note:** `awsAlb` is known as `awsLb`. The functionality is identical.

Provides information about a Load Balancer.

This data source can prove useful when a module accepts an LB as an input
variable and needs to, for example, determine the security groups associated
with it, etc.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
/*Terraform Variables are not always the best fit for getting inputs in the context of Terraform CDK.
You can read more about this at https://cdk.tf/variables*/
const lbArn = new cdktf.TerraformVariable(this, "lb_arn", {
  default: "",
});
const lbName = new cdktf.TerraformVariable(this, "lb_name", {
  default: "",
});
new aws.dataAwsLb.DataAwsLb(this, "test", {
  arn: lbArn.value,
  name: lbName.value,
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `arn` - (Optional) Full ARN of the load balancer.
* `name` - (Optional) Unique name of the load balancer.
* `tags` - (Optional) Mapping of tags, each pair of which must exactly match a pair on the desired load balancer.

\~> **NOTE:** When both `arn` and `name` are specified, `arn` takes precedence. `tags` has lowest precedence.

## Attributes Reference

See the [LB Resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/lb.html) for details on the
returned attributes - they are identical.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):
