# Data Source: awsEc2TransitGatewayVpnAttachment

Get information on an EC2 Transit Gateway VPN Attachment.

\-> EC2 Transit Gateway VPN Attachments are implicitly created by VPN Connections referencing an EC2 Transit Gateway so there is no managed resource. For ease, the [`awsVpnConnection` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/vpn_connection.html) includes a `transitGatewayAttachmentId` attribute which can replace some usage of this data source. For tagging the attachment, see the [`awsEc2Tag` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/ec2_tag.html).

## Example Usage

### By Transit Gateway and VPN Connection Identifiers

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.dataAwsEc2TransitGatewayVpnAttachment.DataAwsEc2TransitGatewayVpnAttachment(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    transitGatewayId: "${aws_ec2_transit_gateway.example.id}",
    vpnConnectionId: "${aws_vpn_connection.example.id}",
  }
);

```

### Filter

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.dataAwsEc2TransitGatewayVpnAttachment.DataAwsEc2TransitGatewayVpnAttachment(
  this,
  "test",
  {
    filter: [
      {
        name: "resource-id",
        values: ["some-resource"],
      },
    ],
  }
);

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `transitGatewayId` - (Optional) Identifier of the EC2 Transit Gateway.
* `vpnConnectionId` - (Optional) Identifier of the EC2 VPN Connection.
* `filter` - (Optional) Configuration block(s) for filtering. Detailed below.
* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags, each pair of which must exactly match a pair on the desired Transit Gateway VPN Attachment.

### filter Configuration Block

The following arguments are supported by the `filter` configuration block:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the filter field. Valid values can be found in the [EC2 DescribeTransitGatewayAttachments API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeTransitGatewayAttachments.html).
* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given filter field. Results will be selected if any given value matches.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - EC2 Transit Gateway VPN Attachment identifier
* `tags` - Key-value tags for the EC2 Transit Gateway VPN Attachment
