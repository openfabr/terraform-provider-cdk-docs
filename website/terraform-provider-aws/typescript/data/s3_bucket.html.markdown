Provides details about a specific S3 bucket.

This resource may prove useful when setting up a Route53 record, or an origin for a CloudFront
Distribution.

## Example Usage

### Route53 Record

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const dataAwsRoute53ZoneTestZone =
  new aws.dataAwsRoute53Zone.DataAwsRoute53Zone(this, "test_zone", {
    name: "test.com.",
  });
const dataAwsS3BucketSelected = new aws.dataAwsS3Bucket.DataAwsS3Bucket(
  this,
  "selected",
  {
    bucket: "bucket.test.com",
  }
);
new aws.route53Record.Route53Record(this, "example", {
  alias: {
    name: dataAwsS3BucketSelected.websiteDomain,
    zoneId: dataAwsS3BucketSelected.hostedZoneId,
  },
  name: "bucket",
  type: "A",
  zoneId: dataAwsRoute53ZoneTestZone.id,
});

```

### CloudFront Origin

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const dataAwsS3BucketSelected = new aws.dataAwsS3Bucket.DataAwsS3Bucket(
  this,
  "selected",
  {
    bucket: "a-test-bucket",
  }
);
new aws.cloudfrontDistribution.CloudfrontDistribution(this, "test", {
  origin: [
    {
      domainName: dataAwsS3BucketSelected.bucketDomainName,
      originId: "s3-selected-bucket",
    },
  ],
});

```
