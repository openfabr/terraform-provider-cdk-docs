# Data Source: awsCloudfrontOriginAccessIdentity

Use this data source to retrieve information for an Amazon CloudFront origin access identity.

## Example Usage

The following example below creates a CloudFront origin access identity.

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.dataAwsCloudfrontOriginAccessIdentity.DataAwsCloudfrontOriginAccessIdentity(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    id: "EDFDVBD632BHDS5",
  }
);

```

## Argument Reference

* `id` (Required) -  The identifier for the distribution. For example: `edfdvbd632Bhds5`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `callerReference` - Internal value used by CloudFront to allow future
  updates to the origin access identity.
* `cloudfrontAccessIdentityPath` - A shortcut to the full path for the
  origin access identity to use in CloudFront, see below.
* `comment` - An optional comment for the origin access identity.
* `etag` - Current version of the origin access identity's information.
  For example: `e2Qwruhapomqzl`.
* `iamArn` - Pre-generated ARN for use in S3 bucket policies (see below).
  Example: `arn:aws:iam::cloudfront:user/cloudFrontOriginAccessIdentity
  E2Qwruhapomqzl`.
* `s3CanonicalUserId` - The Amazon S3 canonical user ID for the origin
  access identity, which you use when giving the origin access identity read
  permission to an object in Amazon S3.
