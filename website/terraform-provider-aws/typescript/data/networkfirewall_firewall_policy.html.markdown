# Data Source: awsNetworkfirewallFirewallPolicy

Retrieve information about a firewall policy.

## Example Usage

### Find firewall policy by name

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.dataAwsNetworkfirewallFirewallPolicy.DataAwsNetworkfirewallFirewallPolicy(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    name: "${var.firewall_policy_name}",
  }
);

```

### Find firewall policy by ARN

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.dataAwsNetworkfirewallFirewallPolicy.DataAwsNetworkfirewallFirewallPolicy(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    arn: "${var.firewall_policy_arn}",
  }
);

```

### Find firewall policy by name and ARN

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.dataAwsNetworkfirewallFirewallPolicy.DataAwsNetworkfirewallFirewallPolicy(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    arn: "${var.firewall_policy_arn}",
    name: "${var.firewall_policy_name}",
  }
);

```

AWS Network Firewall does not allow multiple firewall policies with the same name to be created in an account. It is possible, however, to have multiple firewall policies available in a single account with identical `name` values but distinct `arn` values, e.g. firewall policies shared via a [Resource Access Manager (RAM) share][1]. In that case specifying `arn`, or `name` and `arn`, is recommended.

\~> **Note:** If there are multiple firewall policies in an account with the same `name`, and `arn` is not specified, the default behavior will return the firewall policy with `name` that was created in the account.

## Argument Reference

One or more of the following arguments are required:

* `arn` - ARN of the firewall policy.
* `name` - Descriptive name of the firewall policy.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `description` - Description of the firewall policy.
* `firewallPolicy` - The [policy][2] for the specified firewall policy.
* `tags` - Key-value tags for the firewall policy.
* `updateToken` - Token used for optimistic locking.
