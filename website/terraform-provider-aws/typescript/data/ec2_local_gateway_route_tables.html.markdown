# Data Source: awsEc2LocalGatewayRouteTables

Provides information for multiple EC2 Local Gateway Route Tables, such as their identifiers.

## Example Usage

The following shows outputting all Local Gateway Route Table Ids.

```typescript
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const dataAwsEc2LocalGatewayRouteTablesFoo =
  new aws.dataAwsEc2LocalGatewayRouteTables.DataAwsEc2LocalGatewayRouteTables(
    this,
    "foo",
    {}
  );
const cdktfTerraformOutputFoo = new cdktf.TerraformOutput(this, "foo_1", {
  value: dataAwsEc2LocalGatewayRouteTablesFoo.ids,
});
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
cdktfTerraformOutputFoo.overrideLogicalId("foo");

```

## Argument Reference

*   `tags` - (Optional) Mapping of tags, each pair of which must exactly match
    a pair on the desired local gateway route table.

*   `filter` - (Optional) Custom filter block as described below.

More complex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks,
which take the following arguments:

*   `name` - (Required) Name of the field to filter by, as defined by
    [the underlying AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeLocalGatewayRouteTables.html).

*   `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field.
    A Local Gateway Route Table will be selected if any one of the given values matches.

## Attributes Reference

* `id` - AWS Region.
* `ids` - Set of Local Gateway Route Table identifiers

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

* `read` - (Default `20M`)
