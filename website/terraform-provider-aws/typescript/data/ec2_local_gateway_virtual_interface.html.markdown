# Data Source: awsEc2LocalGatewayVirtualInterface

Provides details about an EC2 Local Gateway Virtual Interface. More information can be found in the [Outposts User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/outposts-networking-components.html#routing).

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const dataAwsEc2LocalGatewayVirtualInterfaceExample =
  new aws.dataAwsEc2LocalGatewayVirtualInterface.DataAwsEc2LocalGatewayVirtualInterface(
    this,
    "example",
    {
      id: "${each.value}",
    }
  );
/*In most cases loops should be handled in the programming language context and 
not inside of the Terraform context. If you are looping over something external, e.g. a variable or a file input
you should consider using a for loop. If you are looping over something only known to Terraform, e.g. a result of a data source
you need to keep this like it is.*/
dataAwsEc2LocalGatewayVirtualInterfaceExample.addOverride(
  "for_each",
  "${data.aws_ec2_local_gateway_virtual_interface_group.example.local_gateway_virtual_interface_ids}"
);

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are optional:

* `filter` - (Optional) One or more configuration blocks containing name-values filters. See the [EC2 API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeLocalGatewayVirtualInterfaces.html) for supported filters. Detailed below.
* `id` - (Optional) Identifier of EC2 Local Gateway Virtual Interface.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of resource tags, each pair of which must exactly match a pair on the desired local gateway route table.

### filter Argument Reference

The `filter` configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the filter.
* `values` - (Required) List of one or more values for the filter.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `localAddress` - Local address.
* `localBgpAsn` - Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous System Number (ASN) of the EC2 Local Gateway.
* `localGatewayId` - Identifier of the EC2 Local Gateway.
* `peerAddress` - Peer address.
* `peerBgpAsn` - Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous System Number (ASN) of the peer.
* `vlan` - Virtual Local Area Network.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):
