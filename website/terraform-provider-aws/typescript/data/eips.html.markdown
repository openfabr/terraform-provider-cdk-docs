import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const dataAwsEipsExample = new aws.dataAwsEips.DataAwsEips(this, "example", {
  tags: {
    Env: "dev",
  },
});
new cdktf.TerraformOutput(this, "allocation_ids", {
  value: dataAwsEipsExample.allocationIds,
});
new cdktf.TerraformOutput(this, "public_ips", {
  value: dataAwsEipsExample.publicIps,
});

```

## Argument Reference

* `filter` - (Optional) Custom filter block as described below.

  [the underlying AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAddresses.html).

## Attributes Reference

* `id` - AWS Region.
* `allocationIds` - List of all the allocation IDs for address for use with EC2-VPC.
* `publicIps` - List of all the Elastic IP addresses.
