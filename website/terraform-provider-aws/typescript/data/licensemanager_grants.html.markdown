# Data Source: awsLicensemanagerGrants

This resource can be used to get a set of license grant ARNs matching a filter.

## Example Usage

The following shows getting all license grant ARNs granted to your account.

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const dataAwsCallerIdentityCurrent =
  new aws.dataAwsCallerIdentity.DataAwsCallerIdentity(this, "current", {});
new aws.dataAwsLicensemanagerGrants.DataAwsLicensemanagerGrants(this, "test", {
  filter: [
    {
      name: "GranteePrincipalARN",
      values: [
        `arn:aws:iam::\${${dataAwsCallerIdentityCurrent.accountId}}:root`,
      ],
    },
  ],
});

```

## Argument Reference

* `filter` - (Optional) Custom filter block as described below.

More complex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks,

  [the underlying AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/license-manager/latest/APIReference/API_ListReceivedGrants.html#API_ListReceivedGrants_RequestSyntax).
  For example, if filtering using `productSku`, use:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.dataAwsLicensemanagerGrants.DataAwsLicensemanagerGrants(
  this,
  "selected",
  {
    filter: [
      {
        name: "ProductSKU",
        values: [""],
      },
    ],
  }
);

```

* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field.

## Attributes Reference
