  Compose and decompose AWS service DNS names
---

# Data Source: awsService

Use this data source to compose and decompose AWS service DNS names.

## Example Usage

### Get Service DNS Name

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const dataAwsRegionCurrent = new aws.dataAwsRegion.DataAwsRegion(
  this,
  "current",
  {}
);
new aws.dataAwsService.DataAwsService(this, "test", {
  region: dataAwsRegionCurrent.name,
  serviceId: "ec2",
});

```

### Use Service Reverse DNS Name to Get Components

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.dataAwsService.DataAwsService(this, "s3", {
  reverseDnsName: "cn.com.amazonaws.cn-north-1.s3",
});

```

### Determine Regional Support for a Service

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.dataAwsService.DataAwsService(this, "s3", {
  reverseDnsName: "com.amazonaws.us-gov-west-1.waf",
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are optional:

* `dnsName` - (Optional) DNS name of the service (*e.g.,* `rdsUsEast1AmazonawsCom`). One of `dnsName`, `reverseDnsName`, or `serviceId` is required.
* `partition` - (Optional) Partition corresponding to the region.
* `region` - (Optional) Region of the service (*e.g.,* `usWest2`, `apNortheast1`).
* `reverseDnsName` - (Optional) Reverse DNS name of the service (*e.g.,* `comAmazonawsUsWest2S3`). One of `dnsName`, `reverseDnsName`, or `serviceId` is required.
* `reverseDnsPrefix` - (Optional) Prefix of the service (*e.g.,* `comAmazonaws` in AWS Commercial, `cnComAmazonaws` in AWS China).
* `serviceId` - (Optional) Service (*e.g.,* `s3`, `rds`, `ec2`). One of `dnsName`, `reverseDnsName`, or `serviceId` is required.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `supported` - Whether the service is supported in the region's partition. New services may not be listed immediately as supported.
