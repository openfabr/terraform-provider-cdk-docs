    Provides a list of network ACL ids for a VPC
---

# Data Source: awsNetworkAcls

## Example Usage

The following shows outputting all network ACL ids in a vpc.

```typescript
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
const dataAwsNetworkAclsExample = new aws.dataAwsNetworkAcls.DataAwsNetworkAcls(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    vpcId: "${var.vpc_id}",
  }
);
const cdktfTerraformOutputExample = new cdktf.TerraformOutput(
  this,
  "example_1",
  {
    value: dataAwsNetworkAclsExample.ids,
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
cdktfTerraformOutputExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

The following example retrieves a list of all network ACL ids in a VPC with a custom
tag of `tier` set to a value of "Private".

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.dataAwsNetworkAcls.DataAwsNetworkAcls(this, "example", {
  tags: {
    Tier: "Private",
  },
  vpcId: "${var.vpc_id}",
});

```

The following example retrieves a network ACL id in a VPC which associated
with specific subnet.

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as aws from "./.gen/providers/aws";
new aws.dataAwsNetworkAcls.DataAwsNetworkAcls(this, "example", {
  filter: [
    {
      name: "association.subnet-id",
      values: ["${aws_subnet.test.id}"],
    },
  ],
  vpcId: "${var.vpc_id}",
});

```

## Argument Reference

*   `vpcId` - (Optional) VPC ID that you want to filter from.

*   `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags, each pair of which must exactly match
    a pair on the desired network ACLs.

*   `filter` - (Optional) Custom filter block as described below.

More complex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks,
which take the following arguments:

*   `name` - (Required) Name of the field to filter by, as defined by
    [the underlying AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeNetworkAcls.html).

*   `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field.
    A VPC will be selected if any one of the given values matches.

## Attributes Reference

* `id` - AWS Region.
* `ids` - List of all the network ACL ids found.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

* `read` - (Default `20M`)
