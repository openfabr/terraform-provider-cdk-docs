# google\_access\_approval\_folder\_service\_account

Get the email address of a folder's Access Approval service account.

Each Google Cloud folder has a unique service account used by Access Approval.
When using Access Approval with a
[custom signing key](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-provider-access-management/access-approval/docs/review-approve-access-requests-custom-keys),
this account needs to be granted the `cloudkmsSignerVerifier` IAM role on the
Cloud KMS key used to sign approvals.

## Example Usage

const dataGoogleAccessApprovalFolderServiceAccountServiceAccount =
  new google.dataGoogleAccessApprovalFolderServiceAccount.DataGoogleAccessApprovalFolderServiceAccount(
