Provides access to a zone's attributes within Google Cloud DNS.

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const dataGoogleDnsManagedZoneEnvDnsZone =
  new google.dataGoogleDnsManagedZone.DataGoogleDnsManagedZone(
    this,
    "env_dns_zone",
    {
      name: "qa-zone",
    }
  );
new google.dnsRecordSet.DnsRecordSet(this, "dns", {
  managed_zone: dataGoogleDnsManagedZoneEnvDnsZone.name,
  name: `my-address.\${${dataGoogleDnsManagedZoneEnvDnsZone.dnsName}}`,
  rrdatas: ["test"],

## Argument Reference

*   `name` - (Required) A unique name for the resource.

*   `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project for the Google Cloud DNS zone.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

*   `dnsName` - The fully qualified DNS name of this zone, e.g. `terraformIo`.

*   `description` - A textual description field.

*   `nameServers` - The list of nameservers that will be authoritative for this
    domain. Use NS records to redirect from your DNS provider to these names,
    thus making Google Cloud DNS authoritative for this zone.

*   `visibility` - The zone's visibility: public zones are exposed to the Internet,
    while private zones are visible only to Virtual Private Cloud resources.
