# google\_iam\_testable\_permissions

Retrieve a list of testable permissions for a resource. Testable permissions mean the permissions that user can add or remove in a role at a given resource. The resource can be referenced either via the full resource name or via a URI.

## Example Usage

Retrieve all the supported permissions able to be set on `myProject` that are in either GA or BETA. This is useful for dynamically constructing custom roles.

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
new google.dataGoogleIamTestablePermissions.DataGoogleIamTestablePermissions(
  this,
  "perms",
  {
    full_resource_name:
      "//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/my-project",
    stages: ["GA", "BETA"],
  }
);

```

## Argument Reference

* `fullResourceName` - (Required) See [full resource name documentation](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#full_resource_name) for more detail.
