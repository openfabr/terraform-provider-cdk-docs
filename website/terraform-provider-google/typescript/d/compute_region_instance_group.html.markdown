# google\_compute\_region\_instance\_group

Get a Compute Region Instance Group within GCE.
For more information, see [the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/distributing-instances-with-regional-instance-groups) and [API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/regionInstanceGroups).

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
new google.dataGoogleComputeRegionInstanceGroup.DataGoogleComputeRegionInstanceGroup(
  this,
  "group",
  {
    name: "instance-group-name",
  }
);

```

The most common use of this datasource will be to fetch information about the instances inside regional managed instance groups, for instance:

```hcl
resource "google_compute_region_instance_group_manager" "foo" {
  name               = "some_name"
    ...
  base_instance_name = "foo"
    ...
  instance_template  = google_compute_instance_template.foo.self_link
  target_pools = [google_compute_target_pool.foo.self_link]
    ...
}

data "google_compute_region_instance_group" "data_source" {
  self_link = google_compute_region_instance_group_manager.foo.instance_group
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `name` - (Optional) The name of the instance group.  One of `name` or `selfLink` must be provided.

*   `selfLink` - (Optional) The link to the instance group.  One of `name` or `selfLink` must be provided.

***

*   `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If `selfLink` is provided, this value is ignored.  If neither `selfLink`
    nor `project` are provided, the provider project is used.

*   `region` - (Optional) The region in which the resource belongs.  If `selfLink`
    is provided, this value is ignored.  If neither `selfLink` nor `region` are
    provided, the provider region is used.

## Attributes Reference

The following arguments are exported:

*   `size` - The number of instances in the group.

*   `instances` - List of instances in the group, as a list of resources, each containing:
    * `instance` - URL to the instance.
    * `namedPorts` - List of named ports in the group, as a list of resources, each containing:
      * `port` - Integer port number
      * `name` - String port name
    * `status` - String description of current state of the instance.
