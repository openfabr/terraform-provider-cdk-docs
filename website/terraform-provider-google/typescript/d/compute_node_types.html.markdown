# google\_compute\_node\_types

Provides available node types for Compute Engine sole-tenant nodes in a zone
for a given project. For more information, see [the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/nodes/#types) and [API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/nodeTypes).

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
new google.computeNodeTemplate.ComputeNodeTemplate(this, "tmpl", {
  name: "terraform-test-tmpl",
  node_type: "${data.google_compute_node_types.types.names[0]}",
  region: "us-central1",
});
new google.dataGoogleComputeNodeTypes.DataGoogleComputeNodeTypes(
  this,
  "central1b",
  {
    zone: "us-central1-b",
  }
);

```

*   `zone` (Optional) - The zone to list node types for. Should be in zone of intended node groups and region of referencing node template. If `zone` is not specified, the provider-level zone must be set and is used
    instead.

*   `project` (Optional) - ID of the project to list available node types for.
    Should match the project the nodes of this type will be deployed to.
