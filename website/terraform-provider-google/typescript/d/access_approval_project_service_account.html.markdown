# google\_access\_approval\_project\_service\_account

Get the email address of a project's Access Approval service account.

Each Google Cloud project has a unique service account used by Access Approval.
When using Access Approval with a
[custom signing key](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-provider-access-management/access-approval/docs/review-approve-access-requests-custom-keys),
this account needs to be granted the `cloudkmsSignerVerifier` IAM role on the
Cloud KMS key used to sign approvals.

## Example Usage

const dataGoogleAccessApprovalProjectServiceAccountServiceAccount =
  new google.dataGoogleAccessApprovalProjectServiceAccount.DataGoogleAccessApprovalProjectServiceAccount(
    this,
    "service_account",
    {
      project_id: "my-project",
