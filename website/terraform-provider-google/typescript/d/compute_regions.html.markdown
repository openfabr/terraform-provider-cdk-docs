# google\_compute\_regions

Provides access to available Google Compute regions for a given project.
See more about [regions and zones](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/) in the upstream docs.

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const dataGoogleComputeRegionsAvailable =
  new google.dataGoogleComputeRegions.DataGoogleComputeRegions(
    this,
    "available",
    {}
  );
const googleComputeSubnetworkCluster =
  new google.computeSubnetwork.ComputeSubnetwork(this, "cluster", {
    ip_cidr_range: "10.36.${count.index}.0/24",
    name: "my-network",
    network: "my-network",
    region: `\${${dataGoogleComputeRegionsAvailable.names.fqn}[count.index]}`,
  });
/*In most cases loops should be handled in the programming language context and 
not inside of the Terraform context. If you are looping over something external, e.g. a variable or a file input
you should consider using a for loop. If you are looping over something only known to Terraform, e.g. a result of a data source
you need to keep this like it is.*/
googleComputeSubnetworkCluster.addOverride(
  "count",
  `\${length(${dataGoogleComputeRegionsAvailable.names})}`
);

```
