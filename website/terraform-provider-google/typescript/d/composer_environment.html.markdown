# google\_composer\_environment

Provides access to Cloud Composer environment configuration in a region for a given project.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const googleComposerEnvironmentComposerEnv =
  new google.composerEnvironment.ComposerEnvironment(this, "composer_env", {
    name: "composer-environment",
  });
const dataGoogleComposerEnvironmentComposerEnv =
  new google.dataGoogleComposerEnvironment.DataGoogleComposerEnvironment(
    this,
    "composer_env_1",
    {
      depends_on: [`\${${googleComposerEnvironmentComposerEnv.fqn}}`],
      name: "${google_composer_environment.test.name}",
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
dataGoogleComposerEnvironmentComposerEnv.overrideLogicalId("composer_env");
new cdktf.TerraformOutput(this, "debug", {
  value: dataGoogleComposerEnvironmentComposerEnv.config,
});
