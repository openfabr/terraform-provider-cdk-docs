# google\_monitoring\_mesh\_istio\_service

A Monitoring Service is the root resource under which operational aspects of a
generic service are accessible. A service is some discrete, autonomous, and
network-accessible unit, designed to solve an individual concern

An Mesh Istio monitoring service is automatically created by GCP to monitor
Mesh Istio services.

For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
new google.dataGoogleMonitoringMeshIstioService.DataGoogleMonitoringMeshIstioService(
  this,
  "default",
  {
    mesh_uid: "proj-573164786102",
