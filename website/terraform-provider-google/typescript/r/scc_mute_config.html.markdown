Mute Findings is a volume management feature in Security Command Center
that lets you manually or programmatically hide irrelevant findings,
and create filters to automatically silence existing and future
findings based on criteria you specify.

To get more information about MuteConfig, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/reference/rest/v1/organizations.muteConfigs)

## Example Usage - Scc Mute Config

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
new google.sccMuteConfig.SccMuteConfig(this, "default", {
  description: "My Mute Config",
  filter: 'category: "OS_VULNERABILITY"',
  mute_config_id: "my-config",
  parent: "organizations/123456789",
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `filter` -
    (Required)
    An expression that defines the filter to apply across create/update
    events of findings. While creating a filter string, be mindful of
    the scope in which the mute configuration is being created. E.g.,
    If a filter contains project = X but is created under the
    project = Y scope, it might not match any findings.

*   `muteConfigId` -
    (Required)
    Unique identifier provided by the client within the parent scope.

*   `parent` -
    (Required)
    Resource name of the new mute configs's parent. Its format is
    "organizations/\[organization\_id]", "folders/\[folder\_id]", or
    "projects/\[project\_id]".

***

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  A description of the mute config.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

*   `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `{{name}}`

*   `name` -
    Name of the mute config. Its format is
    organizations/{organization}/muteConfigs/{configId},
    folders/{folder}/muteConfigs/{configId},
    or projects/{project}/muteConfigs/{configId}

*   `createTime` -
    The time at which the mute config was created. This field is set by
    the server and will be ignored if provided on config creation.

*   `updateTime` -
    Output only. The most recent time at which the mute config was
    updated. This field is set by the server and will be ignored if
    provided on config creation or update.

*   `mostRecentEditor` -
    Email address of the user who last edited the mute config. This
    field is set by the server and will be ignored if provided on
    config creation or update.
