## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
  created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
  RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
  the regular expression `[aZ]([AZ09]*[aZ09])?` which means the
  first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
  characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
  character, which cannot be a dash.

***

*   `defaultService` -
    (Optional)
    The full or partial URL of the defaultService resource to which traffic is directed if
    none of the hostRules match. If defaultRouteAction is additionally specified, advanced
    routing actions like URL Rewrites, etc. take effect prior to sending the request to the
    backend. However, if defaultService is specified, defaultRouteAction cannot contain any
    weightedBackendServices. Conversely, if routeAction specifies any
    weightedBackendServices, service must not be specified.  Only one of defaultService,
    defaultUrlRedirect or defaultRouteAction.weightedBackendService must be set.

*   `description` -
    (Optional)
    An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when
    you create the resource.

*   `hostRule` -
    (Optional)
    The list of HostRules to use against the URL.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_host_rule).

*   `pathMatcher` -
    (Optional)
    The list of named PathMatchers to use against the URL.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_path_matcher).

*   `test` -
    (Optional)
    The list of expected URL mappings. Requests to update this UrlMap will
    succeed only if all of the test cases pass.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_test).

*   `defaultUrlRedirect` -
    (Optional)
    When none of the specified hostRules match, the request is redirected to a URL specified
    by defaultUrlRedirect. If defaultUrlRedirect is specified, defaultService or
    defaultRouteAction must not be set.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_default_url_redirect).

*   `defaultRouteAction` -
    (Optional)
    defaultRouteAction takes effect when none of the hostRules match. The load balancer performs advanced routing actions, such as URL rewrites and header transformations, before forwarding the request to the selected backend. If defaultRouteAction specifies any weightedBackendServices, defaultService must not be set. Conversely if defaultService is set, defaultRouteAction cannot contain any weightedBackendServices.
    Only one of defaultRouteAction or defaultUrlRedirect must be set.
    URL maps for Classic external HTTP(S) load balancers only support the urlRewrite action within defaultRouteAction.
    defaultRouteAction has no effect when the URL map is bound to a target gRPC proxy that has the validateForProxyless field set to true.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_default_route_action).

*   `region` -
    (Optional)
    The Region in which the url map should reside.
    If it is not provided, the provider region is used.

*   `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

<a name="nested_host_rule"></a>The `hostRule` block supports:

*   `description` -
    (Optional)
    An optional description of this HostRule. Provide this property
    when you create the resource.

*   `hosts` -
    (Required)
    The list of host patterns to match. They must be valid
    hostnames, except \* will match any string of (\[a-z0-9-.]\*). In
    that case, \* must be the first character and must be followed in
    the pattern by either - or ..

*   `pathMatcher` -
    (Required)
    The name of the PathMatcher to use to match the path portion of
    the URL if the hostRule matches the URL's host portion.

<a name="nested_path_matcher"></a>The `pathMatcher` block supports:

*   `defaultService` -
    (Optional)
    A reference to a RegionBackendService resource. This will be used if
    none of the pathRules defined by this PathMatcher is matched by
    the URL's path portion.

*   `description` -
    (Optional)
    An optional description of this resource.

*   `name` -
    (Required)
    The name to which this PathMatcher is referred by the HostRule.

*   `routeRules` -
    (Optional)
    The list of ordered HTTP route rules. Use this list instead of pathRules when
    advanced route matching and routing actions are desired. The order of specifying
    routeRules matters: the first rule that matches will cause its specified routing
    action to take effect. Within a given pathMatcher, only one of pathRules or
    routeRules must be set. routeRules are not supported in UrlMaps intended for
    External load balancers.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_route_rules).

*   `pathRule` -
    (Optional)
    The list of path rules. Use this list instead of routeRules when routing based
    on simple path matching is all that's required. The order by which path rules
    are specified does not matter. Matches are always done on the longest-path-first
    basis. For example: a pathRule with a path /a/b/c/\* will match before /a/b/\*
    irrespective of the order in which those paths appear in this list. Within a
    given pathMatcher, only one of pathRules or routeRules must be set.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_path_rule).

*   `defaultUrlRedirect` -
    (Optional)
    When none of the specified hostRules match, the request is redirected to a URL specified
    by defaultUrlRedirect. If defaultUrlRedirect is specified, defaultService or
    defaultRouteAction must not be set.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_default_url_redirect).

<a name="nested_route_rules"></a>The `routeRules` block supports:

*   `priority` -
    (Required)
    For routeRules within a given pathMatcher, priority determines the order
    in which load balancer will interpret routeRules. RouteRules are evaluated
    in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. The priority of
    a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1). The first rule
    that matches the request is applied.
    You cannot configure two or more routeRules with the same priority.
    Priority for each rule must be set to a number between 0 and
    2147483647 inclusive.
    Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules
    in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example,
    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers to which
    you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the
    future without any impact on existing rules.

*   `service` -
    (Optional)
    The region backend service resource to which traffic is
    directed if this rule is matched. If routeAction is additionally specified,
    advanced routing actions like URL Rewrites, etc. take effect prior to sending
    the request to the backend. However, if service is specified, routeAction cannot
    contain any weightedBackendService s. Conversely, if routeAction specifies any
    weightedBackendServices, service must not be specified. Only one of urlRedirect,
    service or routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set.

*   `headerAction` -
    (Optional)
    Specifies changes to request and response headers that need to take effect for
    the selected backendService. The headerAction specified here are applied before
    the matching pathMatchers\[].headerAction and after pathMatchers\[].routeRules\[].r
    outeAction.weightedBackendService.backendServiceWeightAction\[].headerAction
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_header_action).

*   `matchRules` -
    (Optional)
    The rules for determining a match.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_match_rules).

*   `routeAction` -
    (Optional)
    In response to a matching matchRule, the load balancer performs advanced routing
    actions like URL rewrites, header transformations, etc. prior to forwarding the
    request to the selected backend. If  routeAction specifies any
    weightedBackendServices, service must not be set. Conversely if service is set,
    routeAction cannot contain any  weightedBackendServices. Only one of routeAction
    or urlRedirect must be set.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_route_action).

*   `urlRedirect` -
    (Optional)
    When this rule is matched, the request is redirected to a URL specified by
    urlRedirect. If urlRedirect is specified, service or routeAction must not be
    set.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_url_redirect).

<a name="nested_header_action"></a>The `headerAction` block supports:

*   `requestHeadersToAdd` -
    (Optional)
    Headers to add to a matching request prior to forwarding the request to the
    backendService.

    corresponding backend service. If all traffic needs to go to a single backend
    service, there must be one  weightedBackendService with weight set to a non 0
    number. Once a backendService is identified and before forwarding the request to
    the backend service, advanced routing actions like Url rewrites and header
    transformations are applied depending on additional settings specified in this

    timeout and retryPolicy is ignored by clients that are configured with a faultInjectionPolicy if: 1. The traffic is generated by fault injection AND 2. The fault injection is not a delay fault injection.
    Fault injection is not supported with the global external HTTP(S) load balancer (classic). To see which load balancers support fault injection, see Load balancing: [Routing and traffic management features](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/features#routing-traffic-management).
