# google\_sql\_ssl\_cert

Creates a new Google SQL SSL Cert on a Google SQL Instance. For more information, see the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sql/), or the [JSON API](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/admin-api/v1beta4/sslCerts).

\~> **Note:** All arguments including the private key will be stored in the raw state as plain-text.
[Read more about sensitive data in state](https://www.terraform.io/language/state/sensitive-data).

## Example Usage

Example creating a SQL Client Certificate.

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
import * as random from "./.gen/providers/random";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google, random.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const randomIdDbNameSuffix = new random.id.Id(this, "db_name_suffix", {
  byte_length: 4,
});
const googleSqlDatabaseInstanceMain =
  new google.sqlDatabaseInstance.SqlDatabaseInstance(this, "main", {
    database_version: "MYSQL_5_7",
    name: `main-instance-\${${randomIdDbNameSuffix.hex}}`,
    settings: [
      {
        tier: "db-f1-micro",
      },
    ],
  });
new google.sqlSslCert.SqlSslCert(this, "client_cert", {
  common_name: "client-name",
  instance: googleSqlDatabaseInstanceMain.name,
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `instance` - (Required) The name of the Cloud SQL instance. Changing this
    forces a new resource to be created.

*   `commonName` - (Required) The common name to be used in the certificate to identify the
    client. Constrained to \[a-zA-Z.-\_ ]+. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs. If it
    is not provided, the provider project is used.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are
exported:

* `sha1Fingerprint` - The SHA1 Fingerprint of the certificate.
* `privateKey` - The private key associated with the client certificate.
* `serverCaCert` - The CA cert of the server this client cert was generated from.
* `cert` - The actual certificate data for this client certificate.
* `certSerialNumber` - The serial number extracted from the certificate data.
* `createTime` - The time when the certificate was created in RFC 3339 format,
  for example 2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z.
* `expirationTime` - The time when the certificate expires in RFC 3339 format,
  for example 2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z.

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options: configuration options:

* `create` - Default is 10 minutes.
* `delete` - Default is 10 minutes.
