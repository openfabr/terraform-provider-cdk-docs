# google\_compute\_backend\_bucket\_signed\_url\_key

A key for signing Cloud CDN signed URLs for BackendBuckets.

To get more information about BackendBucketSignedUrlKey, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/backendBuckets)
* How-to Guides
  * [Using Signed URLs](https://cloud.google.com/cdn/docs/using-signed-urls/)

\~> **Warning:** All arguments including `keyValue` will be stored in the raw
state as plain-text. [Read more about sensitive data in state](https://www.terraform.io/language/state/sensitive-data).

## Example Usage - Backend Bucket Signed Url Key

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
import * as random from "./.gen/providers/random";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google, random.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const googleStorageBucketBucket = new google.storageBucket.StorageBucket(
  this,
  "bucket",
  {
    location: "EU",
    name: "test-storage-bucket",
  }
);
const randomIdUrlSignature = new random.id.Id(this, "url_signature", {
  byte_length: 16,
});
const googleComputeBackendBucketTestBackend =
  new google.computeBackendBucket.ComputeBackendBucket(this, "test_backend", {
    bucket_name: googleStorageBucketBucket.name,
    description: "Contains beautiful images",
    enable_cdn: true,
    name: "test-signed-backend-bucket",
  });
new google.computeBackendBucketSignedUrlKey.ComputeBackendBucketSignedUrlKey(
  this,
  "backend_key",
  {
    backend_bucket: googleComputeBackendBucketTestBackend.name,
    key_value: randomIdUrlSignature.b64Url,
    name: "test-key",
  }
);

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `name` -
    (Required)
    Name of the signed URL key.

*   `keyValue` -
    (Required)
    128-bit key value used for signing the URL. The key value must be a
    valid RFC 4648 Section 5 base64url encoded string.
    **Note**: This property is sensitive and will not be displayed in the plan.

*   `backendBucket` -
    (Required)
    The backend bucket this signed URL key belongs.

***

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
  If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/global/backendBuckets/{{backendBucket}}`
