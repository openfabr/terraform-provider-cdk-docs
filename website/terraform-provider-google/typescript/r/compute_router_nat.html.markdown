# google\_compute\_router\_nat

A NAT service created in a router.

To get more information about RouterNat, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/routers)
* How-to Guides
  * [Google Cloud Router](https://cloud.google.com/router/docs/)

## Example Usage - Router Nat Basic

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const googleComputeNetworkNet = new google.computeNetwork.ComputeNetwork(
  this,
  "net",
  {
    name: "my-network",
  }
);
const googleComputeSubnetworkSubnet =
  new google.computeSubnetwork.ComputeSubnetwork(this, "subnet", {
    ip_cidr_range: "10.0.0.0/16",
    name: "my-subnetwork",
    network: googleComputeNetworkNet.id,
    region: "us-central1",
  });
const googleComputeRouterRouter = new google.computeRouter.ComputeRouter(
  this,
  "router",
  {
    bgp: [
      {
        asn: 64514,
      },
    ],
    name: "my-router",
    network: googleComputeNetworkNet.id,
    region: googleComputeSubnetworkSubnet.region,
  }
);
new google.computeRouterNat.ComputeRouterNat(this, "nat", {
  log_config: [
    {
      enable: true,
      filter: "ERRORS_ONLY",
    },
  ],
  name: "my-router-nat",

  region: googleComputeRouterRouter.region,
  router: googleComputeRouterRouter.name,
  source_subnetwork_ip_ranges_to_nat: "ALL_SUBNETWORKS_ALL_IP_RANGES",
});

```

## Example Usage - Router Nat Manual Ips

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/

  this,
  "address",
  {
    name: "nat-manual-ip-${count.index}",

/*In most cases loops should be handled in the programming language context and 
not inside of the Terraform context. If you are looping over something external, e.g. a variable or a file input
you should consider using a for loop. If you are looping over something only known to Terraform, e.g. a result of a data source
you need to keep this like it is.*/
googleComputeAddressAddress.addOverride("count", 2);
const googleComputeRouterRouter = new google.computeRouter.ComputeRouter(
  this,
  "router",
  {
    name: "my-router",

    If minPortsPerVm is set, minPortsPerVm must be set to a power of two greater than or equal to 32.
    If minPortsPerVm is not set, a minimum of 32 ports will be allocated to a VM from this NAT config.
    If maxPortsPerVm is set, maxPortsPerVm must be set to a power of two greater than minPortsPerVm.
    If maxPortsPerVm is not set, a maximum of 65536 ports will be allocated to a VM from this NAT config.
