# IAM policy for Spanner Instances

Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for a Spanner instance. Each of these resources serves a different use case:

* `googleSpannerInstanceIamPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the instance and replaces any existing policy already attached.

\~> **Warning:** It's entirely possibly to lock yourself out of your instance using `googleSpannerInstanceIamPolicy`. Any permissions granted by default will be removed unless you include them in your config.

* `googleSpannerInstanceIamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the instance are preserved.
* `googleSpannerInstanceIamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the instance are preserved.

\~> **Note:** `googleSpannerInstanceIamPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `googleSpannerInstanceIamBinding` and `googleSpannerInstanceIamMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.

\~> **Note:** `googleSpannerInstanceIamBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `googleSpannerInstanceIamMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `instance` - (Required) The name of the instance.

*   `member/members` - (Required) Identities that will be granted the privilege in `role`.
    Each entry can have one of the following values:
    * **allUsers**: A special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet; with or without a Google account.
    * **allAuthenticatedUsers**: A special identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.
    * **user:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, alice@gmail.com or joe@example.com.
    * **serviceAccount:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a service account. For example, my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com.
    * **group:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, admins@example.com.
    * **domain:{domain}**: A G Suite domain (primary, instead of alias) name that represents all the users of that domain. For example, google.com or example.com.

*   `role` - (Required) The role that should be applied. Only one
    `googleSpannerInstanceIamBinding` can be used per role. Note that custom roles must be of the format
    `[projects|organizations]/{parentName}/roles/{roleName}`.

*   `policyData` - (Required only by `googleSpannerInstanceIamPolicy`) The policy data generated by
    a `googleIamPolicy` data source.

*   `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs. If it
    is not provided, the provider project is used.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are
exported:

* `etag` - (Computed) The etag of the instance's IAM policy.

## Import

For all import syntaxes, the "resource in question" can take any of the following forms:

* {{project}}/{{name}}
* {{name}} (project is taken from provider project)

IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiers; the resource in question, the role, and the account, e.g.

```console
$ terraform import google_spanner_instance_iam_member.instance "project-name/instance-name roles/viewer user:foo@example.com"
```

IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers; the resource in question and the role, e.g.

```console
$ terraform import google_spanner_instance_iam_binding.instance "project-name/instance-name roles/viewer"
```

IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question, e.g.

```console
$ terraform import google_spanner_instance_iam_policy.instance project-name/instance-name
```

\-> **Custom Roles**: If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the
full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/myProject|organizations/myOrg]/roles/myCustomRole`.
