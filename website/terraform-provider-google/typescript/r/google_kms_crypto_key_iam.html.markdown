# IAM policy for Google Cloud KMS crypto key

Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for KMS crypto key. Each of these resources serves a different use case:

* `googleKmsCryptoKeyIamPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the crypto key and replaces any existing policy already attached.
* `googleKmsCryptoKeyIamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the crypto key are preserved.
* `googleKmsCryptoKeyIamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the crypto key are preserved.

\~> **Note:** `googleKmsCryptoKeyIamPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `googleKmsCryptoKeyIamBinding` and `googleKmsCryptoKeyIamMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.

\~> **Note:** `googleKmsCryptoKeyIamBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `googleKmsCryptoKeyIamMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `cryptoKeyId` - (Required) The crypto key ID, in the form
    `{projectId}/{locationName}/{keyRingName}/{cryptoKeyName}` or
    `{locationName}/{keyRingName}/{cryptoKeyName}`. In the second form,
    the provider's project setting will be used as a fallback.

*   `member/members` - (Required) Identities that will be granted the privilege in `role`.
    Each entry can have one of the following values:
    * **allUsers**: A special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet; with or without a Google account.
    * **allAuthenticatedUsers**: A special identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.
    * **user:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, jane@example.com or joe@example.com.
    * **serviceAccount:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a service account. For example, my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com.
    * **group:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, admins@example.com.
    * **domain:{domain}**: A G Suite domain (primary, instead of alias) name that represents all the users of that domain. For example, google.com or example.com.

*   `role` - (Required) The role that should be applied. Note that custom roles must be of the format
    `[projects|organizations]/{parentName}/roles/{roleName}`.

*   `policyData` - (Required only by `googleKmsCryptoKeyIamPolicy`) The policy data generated by
    a `googleIamPolicy` data source.

*   `condition` - (Optional, [Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/provider_versions.html)) An [IAM Condition](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview) for a given binding.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_condition).

***

<a name="nested_condition"></a>The `condition` block supports:

*   `expression` - (Required) Textual representation of an expression in Common Expression Language syntax.

*   `title` - (Required) A title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing its purpose.

*   `description` - (Optional) An optional description of the expression. This is a longer text which describes the expression, e.g. when hovered over it in a UI.

\~> **Warning:** Terraform considers the `role` and condition contents (`title`+`description`+`expression`) as the
identifier for the binding. This means that if any part of the condition is changed out-of-band, Terraform will
consider it to be an entirely different resource and will treat it as such.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are
exported:

* `etag` - (Computed) The etag of the project's IAM policy.

## Import

IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiers; the resource in question, the role, and the account.  This member resource can be imported using the `cryptoKeyId`, role, and member identity e.g.

```console
$ terraform import google_kms_crypto_key_iam_member.crypto_key "your-project-id/location-name/key-ring-name/key-name roles/viewer user:foo@example.com"
```

IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers; first the resource in question and then the role.  These bindings can be imported using the `cryptoKeyId` and role, e.g.

```console
$ terraform import google_kms_crypto_key_iam_binding.crypto_key "your-project-id/location-name/key-ring-name/key-name roles/editor"
```

IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question.  This policy resource can be imported using the `cryptoKeyId`, e.g.

```console
$ terraform import google_kms_crypto_key_iam_policy.crypto_key your-project-id/location-name/key-ring-name/key-name
```
