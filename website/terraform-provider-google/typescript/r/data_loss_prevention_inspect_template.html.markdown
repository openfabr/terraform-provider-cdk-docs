  (Required)
  Name of the information type. Either a name of your choosing when creating a CustomInfoType, or one of the names listed
  at https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/infotypes-reference when specifying a built-in type.

<a name="nested_rules"></a>The `rules` block supports:

*   `hotwordRule` -
    (Optional)
    Hotword-based detection rule.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_hotword_rule).

*   `exclusionRule` -
    (Optional)
    The rule that specifies conditions when findings of infoTypes specified in InspectionRuleSet are removed from results.

    Regular expression pattern defining what qualifies as a hotword.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_hotword_regex).

*   `proximity` -
    (Required)
    Proximity of the finding within which the entire hotword must reside. The total length of the window cannot
    exceed 1000 characters. Note that the finding itself will be included in the window, so that hotwords may be
    used to match substrings of the finding itself. For example, the certainty of a phone number regex
    `(\d{3}) \d{3}-\d{4}` could be adjusted upwards if the area code is known to be the local area code of a company
    office using the hotword regex `(xxx)`, where `xxx` is the area code in question.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_proximity).

*   `likelihoodAdjustment` -
    (Required)
    Likelihood adjustment to apply to all matching findings.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_likelihood_adjustment).

<a name="nested_hotword_regex"></a>The `hotwordRegex` block supports:

*   `pattern` -
    (Required)
    Pattern defining the regular expression. Its syntax
    (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) can be found under the google/re2 repository on GitHub.

*   `groupIndexes` -
    (Optional)
    The index of the submatch to extract as findings. When not specified,
    the entire match is returned. No more than 3 may be included.

<a name="nested_proximity"></a>The `proximity` block supports:

*   `windowBefore` -
    (Optional)
    Number of characters before the finding to consider. Either this or window\_after must be specified

*   `windowAfter` -
    (Optional)
    Number of characters after the finding to consider. Either this or window\_before must be specified

<a name="nested_likelihood_adjustment"></a>The `likelihoodAdjustment` block supports:

*   `fixedLikelihood` -
    (Optional)
    Set the likelihood of a finding to a fixed value. Either this or relative\_likelihood can be set.
    Possible values are `veryUnlikely`, `unlikely`, `possible`, `likely`, and `veryLikely`.

*   `relativeLikelihood` -
    (Optional)
    Increase or decrease the likelihood by the specified number of levels. For example,
    if a finding would be POSSIBLE without the detection rule and relativeLikelihood is 1,
    then it is upgraded to LIKELY, while a value of -1 would downgrade it to UNLIKELY.
    Likelihood may never drop below VERY\_UNLIKELY or exceed VERY\_LIKELY, so applying an
    adjustment of 1 followed by an adjustment of -1 when base likelihood is VERY\_LIKELY
    will result in a final likelihood of LIKELY. Either this or fixed\_likelihood can be set.

<a name="nested_exclusion_rule"></a>The `exclusionRule` block supports:

  Name of the information type. Either a name of your choosing when creating a CustomInfoType, or one of the names listed
  at https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/infotypes-reference when specifying a built-in type.

<a name="nested_custom_info_types"></a>The `customInfoTypes` block supports:

*   `infoType` -
    (Required)
    CustomInfoType can either be a new infoType, or an extension of built-in infoType, when the name matches one of existing
    infoTypes and that infoType is specified in `infoTypes` field. Specifying the latter adds findings to the
    one detected by the system. If built-in info type is not specified in `infoTypes` list then the name is
    treated as a custom info type.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_info_type).

*   `likelihood` -
    (Optional)
    Likelihood to return for this CustomInfoType. This base value can be altered by a detection rule if the finding meets the criteria
    specified by the rule.
    Default value is `veryLikely`.
    Possible values are `veryUnlikely`, `unlikely`, `possible`, `likely`, and `veryLikely`.

*   `exclusionType` -
    (Optional)
    If set to EXCLUSION\_TYPE\_EXCLUDE this infoType will not cause a finding to be returned. It still can be used for rules matching.
    Possible values are `exclusionTypeExclude`.

*   `regex` -
    (Optional)
    Regular expression which defines the rule.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_regex).

*   `dictionary` -
    (Optional)
    Dictionary which defines the rule.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_dictionary).

*   `storedType` -
    (Optional)
    A reference to a StoredInfoType to use with scanning.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_stored_type).

<a name="nested_info_type"></a>The `infoType` block supports:

* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the information type. Either a name of your choosing when creating a CustomInfoType, or one of the names
  listed at https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/infotypes-reference when specifying a built-in type.

<a name="nested_regex"></a>The `regex` block supports:

*   `pattern` -

*   `groupIndexes` -
    (Optional)
    The index of the submatch to extract as findings. When not specified, the entire match is returned. No more than 3 may be included.

<a name="nested_dictionary"></a>The `dictionary` block supports:

    Newline-delimited file of words in Cloud Storage. Only a single file is accepted.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_cloud_storage_path).

<a name="nested_word_list"></a>The `wordList` block supports:

* `words` -
  (Required)
  Words or phrases defining the dictionary. The dictionary must contain at least one

* `path` -
  (Required)
  A url representing a file or path (no wildcards) in Cloud Storage. Example: `gs://[bucketName]/dictionaryTxt`

<a name="nested_stored_type"></a>The `storedType` block supports:

* `name` -
  (Required)
  Resource name of the requested StoredInfoType, for example `organizations/433245324/storedInfoTypes/432452342`
  or `projects/projectId/storedInfoTypes/432452342`.
