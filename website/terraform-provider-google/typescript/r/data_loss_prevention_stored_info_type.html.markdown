# google\_data\_loss\_prevention\_stored\_info\_type

Allows creation of custom info types.

To get more information about StoredInfoType, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/projects.storedInfoTypes)
* How-to Guides
  * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/creating-stored-infotypes)

## Example Usage - Dlp Stored Info Type Basic

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
new google.dataLossPreventionStoredInfoType.DataLossPreventionStoredInfoType(
  this,
  "basic",
  {
    description: "Description",
    display_name: "Displayname",
    parent: "projects/my-project-name",
    regex: [
      {
        group_indexes: [2],
        pattern: "patient",
      },
    ],
  }
);

```

## Example Usage - Dlp Stored Info Type Dictionary

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
new google.dataLossPreventionStoredInfoType.DataLossPreventionStoredInfoType(
  this,
  "dictionary",
  {
    description: "Description",
    dictionary: [
      {
        word_list: [
          {
