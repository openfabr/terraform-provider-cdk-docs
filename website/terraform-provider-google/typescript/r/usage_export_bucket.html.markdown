# google\_project\_usage\_export\_bucket

Sets up a usage export bucket for a particular project.  A usage export bucket
is a pre-configured GCS bucket which is set up to receive daily and monthly
reports of the GCE resources used.

For more information see the [Docs](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/usage-export)
and for further details, the
[API Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/projects/setUsageExportBucket).

\~> **Note:** You should specify only one of these per project.  If there are two or more
they will fight over which bucket the reports should be stored in.  It is
safe to have multiple resources with the same backing bucket.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
new google.projectUsageExportBucket.ProjectUsageExportBucket(
  this,
  "usage_export",
  {
    bucket_name: "usage-tracking-bucket",
    project: "development-project",
  }
);

```

***

*   `prefix`: (Optional) A prefix for the reports, for instance, the project name.
