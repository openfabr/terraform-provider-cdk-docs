# google\_compute\_target\_pool

Manages a Target Pool within GCE. This is a collection of instances used as
target of a network load balancer (Forwarding Rule). For more information see
[the official
documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/network/target-pools)
and [API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/targetPools).

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const googleComputeHttpHealthCheckDefault =
  new google.computeHttpHealthCheck.ComputeHttpHealthCheck(this, "default", {
    check_interval_sec: 1,
    name: "default",
    request_path: "/",
    timeout_sec: 1,
  });
const googleComputeTargetPoolDefault =
  new google.computeTargetPool.ComputeTargetPool(this, "default_1", {
    health_checks: [googleComputeHttpHealthCheckDefault.name],
    instances: ["us-central1-a/myinstance1", "us-central1-b/myinstance2"],
    name: "instance-pool",
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
googleComputeTargetPoolDefault.overrideLogicalId("default");

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) A unique name for the resource, required by GCE. Changing
  this forces a new resource to be created.

***

*   `backupPool` - (Optional) URL to the backup target pool. Must also set
    failover\_ratio.

*   `description` - (Optional) Textual description field.

*   `failoverRatio` - (Optional) Ratio (0 to 1) of failed nodes before using the
    backup pool (which must also be set).

*   `healthChecks` - (Optional) List of zero or one health check name or self\_link. Only
    legacy `googleComputeHttpHealthCheck` is supported.

*   `instances` - (Optional) List of instances in the pool. They can be given as
    URLs, or in the form of "zone/name". Note that the instances need not exist
    at the time of target pool creation, so there is no need to use the
    Terraform interpolators to create a dependency on the instances from the
    target pool.

*   `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs. If it
    is not provided, the provider project is used.

*   `region` - (Optional) Where the target pool resides. Defaults to project
    region.

*   `sessionAffinity` - (Optional) How to distribute load. Options are "NONE" (no
    affinity). "CLIENT\_IP" (hash of the source/dest addresses / ports), and
    "CLIENT\_IP\_PROTO" also includes the protocol (default "NONE").

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are
exported:

*   `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/targetPools/{{name}}`

*   `selfLink` - The URI of the created resource.

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options: configuration options:

* `create` - Default is 4 minutes.
* `update` - Default is 4 minutes.
* `delete` - Default is 4 minutes.

## Import

Target pools can be imported using any of the following formats:

```console
$ terraform import google_compute_target_pool.default projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/targetPools/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_compute_target_pool.default {{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_compute_target_pool.default {{region}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_compute_target_pool.default {{name}}
```
