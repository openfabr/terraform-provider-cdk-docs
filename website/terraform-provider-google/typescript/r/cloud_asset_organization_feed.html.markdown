## Example Usage - Cloud Asset Organization Feed

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const googlePubsubTopicFeedOutput = new google.pubsubTopic.PubsubTopic(
  this,
  "feed_output",
  {
    name: "network-updates",
    project: "my-project-name",
  }
);
new google.dataGoogleProject.DataGoogleProject(this, "project", {
  project_id: "my-project-name",
});
new google.cloudAssetOrganizationFeed.CloudAssetOrganizationFeed(
  this,
  "organization_feed",
  {
    asset_types: [
      "compute.googleapis.com/Subnetwork",
      "compute.googleapis.com/Network",
    ],
    billing_project: "my-project-name",
    condition: [
      {
        description: "Send notifications on creation events",
        expression:
          "!temporal_asset.deleted &&\ntemporal_asset.prior_asset_state == google.cloud.asset.v1.TemporalAsset.PriorAssetState.DOES_NOT_EXIST\n",
        title: "created",
      },
    ],
    content_type: "RESOURCE",
    feed_id: "network-updates",
    feed_output_config: [
      {
        pubsub_destination: [
          {
            topic: googlePubsubTopicFeedOutput.id,
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
    org_id: "123456789",
  }
);

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `billingProject` -
    (Required)
    The project whose identity will be used when sending messages to the
    destination pubsub topic. It also specifies the project for API
    enablement check, quota, and billing.

*   `feedId` -
    (Required)
    This is the client-assigned asset feed identifier and it needs to be unique under a specific parent.

*   `feedOutputConfig` -
    (Required)
    Output configuration for asset feed destination.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_feed_output_config).

*   `orgId` -
    (Required)
    The organization this feed should be created in.

<a name="nested_feed_output_config"></a>The `feedOutputConfig` block supports:

* `pubsubDestination` -
  (Required)
  Destination on Cloud Pubsub.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_pubsub_destination).

<a name="nested_pubsub_destination"></a>The `pubsubDestination` block supports:

* `topic` -
  (Required)
  Destination on Cloud Pubsub topic.

***

*   `assetNames` -
    (Optional)
    A list of the full names of the assets to receive updates. You must specify either or both of
    assetNames and assetTypes. Only asset updates matching specified assetNames and assetTypes are
    exported to the feed. For example: //compute.googleapis.com/projects/my\_project\_123/zones/zone1/instances/instance1.
    See https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resourceNames#fullResourceName for more info.

*   `assetTypes` -
    (Optional)
    A list of types of the assets to receive updates. You must specify either or both of assetNames
    and assetTypes. Only asset updates matching specified assetNames and assetTypes are exported to
    the feed. For example: "compute.googleapis.com/Disk"
    See https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types for a list of all
    supported asset types.

*   `contentType` -
    (Optional)
    Asset content type. If not specified, no content but the asset name and type will be returned.
    Possible values are `contentTypeUnspecified`, `resource`, `iamPolicy`, `orgPolicy`, and `accessPolicy`.

*   `condition` -
    (Optional)
    A condition which determines whether an asset update should be published. If specified, an asset
    will be returned only when the expression evaluates to true. When set, expression field
    must be a valid CEL expression on a TemporalAsset with name temporal\_asset. Example: a Feed with
    expression "temporal\_asset.deleted == true" will only publish Asset deletions. Other fields of
    condition are optional.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_condition).

<a name="nested_condition"></a>The `condition` block supports:

*   `expression` -
    (Required)
    Textual representation of an expression in Common Expression Language syntax.

*   `title` -
    (Optional)
    Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing its purpose.
    This can be used e.g. in UIs which allow to enter the expression.

*   `description` -
    (Optional)
    Description of the expression. This is a longer text which describes the expression,
    e.g. when hovered over it in a UI.

*   `location` -
    (Optional)
    String indicating the location of the expression for error reporting, e.g. a file
    name and a position in the file.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

*   `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `{{name}}`

*   `name` -
    The format will be organizations/{organization\_number}/feeds/{client-assigned\_feed\_identifier}.
