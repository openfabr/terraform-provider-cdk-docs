Cloud IDS is an intrusion detection service that provides threat detection for intrusions, malware, spyware, and command-and-control attacks on your network.

To get more information about Endpoint, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/intrusion-detection-system/docs/configuring-ids)

## Example Usage - Cloudids Endpoint

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const googleComputeNetworkDefault = new google.computeNetwork.ComputeNetwork(
  this,
  "default",
  {
    name: "tf-test-my-network",
  }
);
const googleComputeGlobalAddressServiceRange =
  new google.computeGlobalAddress.ComputeGlobalAddress(this, "service_range", {
    address_type: "INTERNAL",
    name: "address",
    network: googleComputeNetworkDefault.id,
    prefix_length: 16,
    purpose: "VPC_PEERING",
  });
const googleServiceNetworkingConnectionPrivateServiceConnection =
  new google.serviceNetworkingConnection.ServiceNetworkingConnection(
    this,
    "private_service_connection",
    {
      network: googleComputeNetworkDefault.id,
      reserved_peering_ranges: [googleComputeGlobalAddressServiceRange.name],
      service: "servicenetworking.googleapis.com",
    }
  );
new google.cloudIdsEndpoint.CloudIdsEndpoint(this, "example-endpoint", {
  depends_on: [
    `\${${googleServiceNetworkingConnectionPrivateServiceConnection.fqn}}`,
  ],
  location: "us-central1-f",
  name: "test",
  network: googleComputeNetworkDefault.id,
  severity: "INFORMATIONAL",
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `name` -
    (Required)
    Name of the endpoint in the format projects/{project\_id}/locations/{locationId}/endpoints/{endpointId}.

*   `network` -
    (Required)
    Name of the VPC network that is connected to the IDS endpoint. This can either contain the VPC network name itself (like "src-net") or the full URL to the network (like "projects/{project\_id}/global/networks/src-net").

*   `severity` -
    (Required)

***

*   `description` -
    (Optional)

*   `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/endpoints/{{name}}`

*   `createTime` -
    Creation timestamp in RFC 3339 text format.

*   `updateTime` -
    Last update timestamp in RFC 3339 text format.

*   `endpointForwardingRule` -
    URL of the endpoint's network address to which traffic is to be sent by Packet Mirroring.

*   `endpointIp` -
    Internal IP address of the endpoint's network entry point.
