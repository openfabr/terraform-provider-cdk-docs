# google\_firebase\_hosting\_channel

A `channel` represents a stream of releases for a site. All sites have a default
`live` channel that serves content to the Firebase-provided subdomains and any
connected custom domains.

\~> **Warning:** This resource is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
See [Provider Versions](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html) for more details on beta resources.

To get more information about Channel, see:

* [API documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/hosting/rest/v1beta1/sites.channels)
* How-to Guides
  * [Official Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting)

## Example Usage - Firebasehosting Channel Basic

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const googleFirebaseHostingSiteDefault =
  new google.firebaseHostingSite.FirebaseHostingSite(this, "default", {
    project: "my-project-name",
    provider: "${google-beta}",
    site_id: "site-with-channel",
  });
const googleFirebaseHostingChannelDefault =
  new google.firebaseHostingChannel.FirebaseHostingChannel(this, "default_1", {
    channel_id: "channel-basic",
    provider: "${google-beta}",
    site_id: googleFirebaseHostingSiteDefault.siteId,
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
googleFirebaseHostingChannelDefault.overrideLogicalId("default");

```

## Example Usage - Firebasehosting Channel Full

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const googleFirebaseHostingSiteDefault =
  new google.firebaseHostingSite.FirebaseHostingSite(this, "default", {
    project: "my-project-name",
    provider: "${google-beta}",
    site_id: "site-with-channel",
  });
new google.firebaseHostingChannel.FirebaseHostingChannel(this, "full", {
  channel_id: "channel-full",
  labels: [
    {
      "some-key": "some-value",
    },
  ],
  provider: "${google-beta}",
  retained_release_count: 20,
  site_id: googleFirebaseHostingSiteDefault.siteId,
  ttl: "86400s",
});

```
