## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `assignment` -
    (Required)
    Specifies the VM instances that are assigned to this policy. This allows you to target sets
    or groups of VM instances by different parameters such as labels, names, OS, or zones.
    If left empty, all VM instances underneath this policy are targeted.
    At the same level in the resource hierarchy (that is within a project), the service prevents
    the creation of multiple policies that conflict with each other.
    For more information, see how the service
    [handles assignment conflicts](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/os-config-management/create-guest-policy#handle-conflicts).
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_assignment).

*   `guestPolicyId` -
    (Required)
    The logical name of the guest policy in the project with the following restrictions:
    * Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
    * Must start with a letter.
    * Must be between 1-63 characters.
    * Must end with a number or a letter.
    * Must be unique within the project.

<a name="nested_assignment"></a>The `assignment` block supports:

*   `groupLabels` -
    (Optional)
    Targets instances matching at least one of these label sets. This allows an assignment to target disparate groups,
    for example "env=prod or env=staging".
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_group_labels).

*   `zones` -
    (Optional)
    Targets instances in any of these zones. Leave empty to target instances in any zone.
    Zonal targeting is uncommon and is supported to facilitate the management of changes by zone.

*   `instances` -
    (Optional)
    Targets any of the instances specified. Instances are specified by their URI in the form
    zones/\[ZONE]/instances/\[INSTANCE\_NAME].
    Instance targeting is uncommon and is supported to facilitate the management of changes
    by the instance or to target specific VM instances for development and testing.
    Only supported for project-level policies and must reference instances within this project.

*   `instanceNamePrefixes` -
    (Optional)
    Targets VM instances whose name starts with one of these prefixes.
    Like labels, this is another way to group VM instances when targeting configs,
    for example prefix="prod-".
    Only supported for project-level policies.

*   `osTypes` -
    (Optional)
    Targets VM instances matching at least one of the following OS types.
    VM instances must match all supplied criteria for a given OsType to be included.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_os_types).

<a name="nested_group_labels"></a>The `groupLabels` block supports:

* `labels` -
  (Required)
  Google Compute Engine instance labels that must be present for an instance to be included in this assignment group.

<a name="nested_os_types"></a>The `osTypes` block supports:

    (Optional)
    Targets VM instances with OS Inventory enabled and having the following OS short name, for example "debian" or "windows".

*   `osVersion` -
    (Optional)
    Targets VM instances with OS Inventory enabled and having the following following OS version.

*   `osArchitecture` -
    (Optional)
    Targets VM instances with OS Inventory enabled and having the following OS architecture.

***

*   `description` -
    (Optional)
    Description of the guest policy. Length of the description is limited to 1024 characters.

*   `packages` -
    (Optional)
    The software packages to be managed by this policy.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_packages).

*   `packageRepositories` -
    (Optional)
    A list of package repositories to configure on the VM instance.
    This is done before any other configs are applied so they can use these repos.
    Package repositories are only configured if the corresponding package manager(s) are available.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_package_repositories).

*   `recipes` -
    (Optional)
    A list of Recipes to install on the VM instance.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_recipes).

<a name="nested_yum"></a>The `yum` block supports:

*   `id` -
    (Required)
    A one word, unique name for this repository. This is the repo id in the Yum config file and also the displayName

    (Required)
    Unique identifier for the recipe. Only one recipe with a given name is installed on an instance.
    Names are also used to identify resources which helps to determine whether guest policies have conflicts.
    This means that requests to create multiple recipes with the same name and version are rejected since they
    could potentially have conflicting assignments.

*   `version` -
    (Optional)
    The version of this software recipe. Version can be up to 4 period separated numbers (e.g. 12.34.56.78).

    Structure is [documented below](#nested_update_steps).

*   `desiredState` -
    (Optional)
    Default is INSTALLED. The desired state the agent should maintain for this recipe.
    INSTALLED: The software recipe is installed on the instance but won't be updated to new versions.
    INSTALLED\_KEEP\_UPDATED: The software recipe is installed on the instance. The recipe is updated to a higher version,
    if a higher version of the recipe is assigned to this instance.
    REMOVE: Remove is unsupported for software recipes and attempts to create or update a recipe to the REMOVE state is rejected.
    Default value is `installed`.
    Possible values are `installed`, `updated`, and `removed`.

<a name="nested_artifacts"></a>The `artifacts` block supports:

*   `id` -
    (Required)
    Id of the artifact, which the installation and update steps of this recipe can reference.
    Artifacts in a recipe cannot have the same id.

    Must be provided if allowInsecure is false. SHA256 checksum in hex format, to compare to the checksum of the artifact.
    If the checksum is not empty and it doesn't match the artifact then the recipe installation fails before running any
    of the steps.

<a name="nested_gcs"></a>The `gcs` block supports:

*   `bucket` -
    (Optional)
    Bucket of the Google Cloud Storage object. Given an example URL: https://storage.googleapis.com/my-bucket/foo/bar#1234567

<a name="nested_file_copy"></a>The `fileCopy` block supports:

*   `artifactId` -
    (Required)
    The id of the relevant artifact in the recipe.

*   `destination` -
    (Required)
    The absolute path on the instance to put the file.
