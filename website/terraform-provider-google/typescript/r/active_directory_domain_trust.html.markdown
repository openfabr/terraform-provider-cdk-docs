# google\_active\_directory\_domain\_trust

Adds a trust between Active Directory domains

To get more information about DomainTrust, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/managed-microsoft-ad/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.global.domains/attachTrust)
* How-to Guides
  * [Active Directory Trust](https://cloud.google.com/managed-microsoft-ad/docs/create-one-way-trust)

\~> **Warning:** All arguments including `trustHandshakeSecret` will be stored in the raw
state as plain-text. [Read more about sensitive data in state](https://www.terraform.io/language/state/sensitive-data).

## Example Usage - Active Directory Domain Trust Basic

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
new google.activeDirectoryDomainTrust.ActiveDirectoryDomainTrust(
  this,
  "ad-domain-trust",
  {
    domain: "test-managed-ad.com",
    target_dns_ip_addresses: ["10.1.0.100"],
    target_domain_name: "example-gcp.com",
    trust_direction: "OUTBOUND",
    trust_handshake_secret: "Testing1!",
    trust_type: "FOREST",
  }
);

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `targetDomainName` -
    (Required)
    The fully qualified target domain name which will be in trust with the current domain.

*   `trustType` -
    (Required)
    The type of trust represented by the trust resource.
    Possible values are `forest` and `external`.

*   `trustDirection` -
    (Required)
    The trust direction, which decides if the current domain is trusted, trusting, or both.
    Possible values are `inbound`, `outbound`, and `bidirectional`.

*   `targetDnsIpAddresses` -
    (Required)
    The target DNS server IP addresses which can resolve the remote domain involved in the trust.

*   `trustHandshakeSecret` -
    (Required)
    The trust secret used for the handshake with the target domain. This will not be stored.
    **Note**: This property is sensitive and will not be displayed in the plan.

*   `domain` -
    (Required)
    The fully qualified domain name. e.g. mydomain.myorganization.com, with the restrictions,
    https://cloud.google.com/managed-microsoft-ad/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.global.domains.

***

*   `selectiveAuthentication` -
    (Optional)
    Whether the trusted side has forest/domain wide access or selective access to an approved set of resources.

*   `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/global/domains/{{domain}}/{{targetDomainName}}`
