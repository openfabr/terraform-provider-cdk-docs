# google\_service\_networking\_connection

Manages a private VPC connection with a GCP service provider. For more information see
[the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-services-access#creating-connection)
and
[API](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/service-networking/reference/rest/v1/services.connections).

## Example usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const googleComputeNetworkPeeringNetwork =
  new google.computeNetwork.ComputeNetwork(this, "peering_network", {
    name: "peering-network",
  });
const googleComputeGlobalAddressPrivateIpAlloc =
  new google.computeGlobalAddress.ComputeGlobalAddress(
    this,
    "private_ip_alloc",
    {
      address_type: "INTERNAL",
      name: "private-ip-alloc",
      network: googleComputeNetworkPeeringNetwork.id,
      prefix_length: 16,
      purpose: "VPC_PEERING",
    }
  );
const googleServiceNetworkingConnectionDefault =
  new google.serviceNetworkingConnection.ServiceNetworkingConnection(
    this,
    "default",
    {
      network: googleComputeNetworkPeeringNetwork.id,
      reserved_peering_ranges: [googleComputeGlobalAddressPrivateIpAlloc.name],
      service: "servicenetworking.googleapis.com",
    }
  );
new google.computeNetworkPeeringRoutesConfig.ComputeNetworkPeeringRoutesConfig(
  this,
  "peering_routes",
  {
    export_custom_routes: true,
    import_custom_routes: true,
    network: googleComputeNetworkPeeringNetwork.name,
    peering: googleServiceNetworkingConnectionDefault.peering,
  }
);

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `network` - (Required) Name of VPC network connected with service producers using VPC peering.

*   `service` - (Required) Provider peering service that is managing peering connectivity for a
    service provider organization. For Google services that support this functionality it is
    'servicenetworking.googleapis.com'.

*   `reservedPeeringRanges` - (Required) Named IP address range(s) of PEERING type reserved for
    this service provider. Note that invoking this method with a different range when connection
    is already established will not reallocate already provisioned service producer subnetworks.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `peering` - (Computed) The name of the VPC Network Peering connection that was created by the service producer.

## Import

ServiceNetworkingConnection can be imported using any of these accepted formats

```console
$ terraform import google_service_networking_connection.peering_connection {{peering-network}}:{{service}}

$ terraform import google_service_networking_connection.peering_connection /projects/{{project}}/global/networks/{{peering-network}}:{{service}}
```
