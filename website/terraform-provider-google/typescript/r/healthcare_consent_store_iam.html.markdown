  Collection of resources to manage IAM policy for Cloud Healthcare ConsentStore

# IAM policy for Cloud Healthcare ConsentStore

Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for Cloud Healthcare ConsentStore. Each of these resources serves a different use case:

* `googleHealthcareConsentStoreIamPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the consentstore and replaces any existing policy already attached.
* `googleHealthcareConsentStoreIamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the consentstore are preserved.
* `googleHealthcareConsentStoreIamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the consentstore are preserved.

\~> **Note:** `googleHealthcareConsentStoreIamPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `googleHealthcareConsentStoreIamBinding` and `googleHealthcareConsentStoreIamMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.

\~> **Note:** `googleHealthcareConsentStoreIamBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `googleHealthcareConsentStoreIamMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.

## google\_healthcare\_consent\_store\_iam\_policy

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const dataGoogleIamPolicyAdmin =
  new google.dataGoogleIamPolicy.DataGoogleIamPolicy(this, "admin", {
    binding: [
      {
        members: ["user:jane@example.com"],

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `consentStoreId` - (Required) Used to find the parent resource to bind the IAM policy to

*   `dataset` - (Required) Identifies the dataset addressed by this request. Must be in the format
    'projects/{project}/locations/{location}/datasets/{dataset}'
    Used to find the parent resource to bind the IAM policy to

    * **projectViewer:projectid**: Viewers of the given project. For example, "projectViewer:my-example-project"

*   `role` - (Required) The role that should be applied. Only one
    `googleHealthcareConsentStoreIamBinding` can be used per role. Note that custom roles must be of the format
    `[projects|organizations]/{parentName}/roles/{roleName}`.

*   `policyData` - (Required only by `googleHealthcareConsentStoreIamPolicy`) The policy data generated by
    a `googleIamPolicy` data source.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are
exported:

* `etag` - (Computed) The etag of the IAM policy.

## Import

For all import syntaxes, the "resource in question" can take any of the following forms:

* {{dataset}}/consentStores/{{name}}
* {{name}}

Any variables not passed in the import command will be taken from the provider configuration.

Cloud Healthcare consentstore IAM resources can be imported using the resource identifiers, role, and member.

IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question, the role, and the member identity, e.g.

```console
$ terraform import google_healthcare_consent_store_iam_member.editor "{{dataset}}/consentStores/{{consent_store}} roles/viewer user:jane@example.com"
```

IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question and the role, e.g.

```console
$ terraform import google_healthcare_consent_store_iam_binding.editor "{{dataset}}/consentStores/{{consent_store}} roles/viewer"
```

IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question, e.g.

```console
$ terraform import google_healthcare_consent_store_iam_policy.editor {{dataset}}/consentStores/{{consent_store}}
```

\-> **Custom Roles**: If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the
full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/myProject|organizations/myOrg]/roles/myCustomRole`.
