* How-to Guides
  * [Official Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup)

## Example Usage - Firebase Apple App Basic

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
new google.firebaseAppleApp.FirebaseAppleApp(this, "default", {
  bundle_id: "apple.app.12345",
  display_name: "Display Name Basic",
  project: "my-project-name",
  provider: "${google-beta}",
});

```

## Example Usage - Firebase Apple App Full

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
new google.firebaseAppleApp.FirebaseAppleApp(this, "full", {
  app_store_id: "12345",
  bundle_id: "apple.app.12345",
  display_name: "Display Name Full",
  project: "my-project-name",
  provider: "${google-beta}",
  team_id: "9987654321",
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `displayName` -
  (Required)
  The user-assigned display name of the App.

***

*   `bundleId` -
    (Optional)
    The canonical bundle ID of the Apple app as it would appear in the Apple AppStore.

*   `appStoreId` -
    (Optional)
    The automatically generated Apple ID assigned to the Apple app by Apple in the Apple App Store.

*   `teamId` -
    (Optional)
    The Apple Developer Team ID associated with the App in the App Store.

*   `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

*   `deletionPolicy` - (Optional) (Optional) Set to `abandon` to allow the Apple to be untracked from terraform state

    This identifier should be treated as an opaque token, as the data format is not specified.
