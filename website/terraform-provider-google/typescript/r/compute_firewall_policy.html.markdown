# google\_compute\_firewall\_policy

Hierarchical firewall policy rules let you create and enforce a consistent firewall policy across your organization. Rules can explicitly allow or deny connections or delegate evaluation to lower level policies. Policies can be created within organizations or folders.

This resource should be generally be used with `googleComputeFirewallPolicyAssociation` and `googleComputeFirewallPolicyRule`

import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
new google.computeFirewallPolicy.ComputeFirewallPolicy(this, "default", {
  description: "Example Resource",
  parent: "organizations/12345",
  short_name: "my-policy",
});

```
