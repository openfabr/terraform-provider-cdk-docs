# googleComputeImage

Represents an Image resource.

Google Compute Engine uses operating system images to create the root
persistent disks for your instances. You specify an image when you create
an instance. Images contain a boot loader, an operating system, and a
root file system. Linux operating system images are also capable of
running containers on Compute Engine.

Images can be either public or custom.

Public images are provided and maintained by Google, open-source
communities, and third-party vendors. By default, all projects have
access to these images and can use them to create instances.  Custom
images are available only to your project. You can create a custom image
from root persistent disks and other images. Then, use the custom image
to create an instance.

To get more information about Image, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/v1/images)
* How-to Guides
  * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images)

## Example Usage - Image Basic

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
new google.computeImage.ComputeImage(this, "example", {
  name: "example-image",
  raw_disk: [
    {
      source:

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
  created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
  RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and
  match the regular expression `[aZ]([AZ09]*[aZ09])?` which means
  the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
  characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the
  last character, which cannot be a dash.

***

*   `description` -
    (Optional)
    An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when
    you create the resource.

*   `diskSizeGb` -
    (Optional)
    Size of the image when restored onto a persistent disk (in GB).

*   `family` -
    (Optional)
    The name of the image family to which this image belongs. You can
    create disks by specifying an image family instead of a specific
    image name. The image family always returns its latest image that is
    not deprecated. The name of the image family must comply with
    RFC1035.

*   `guestOsFeatures` -
    (Optional)
    A list of features to enable on the guest operating system.
    Applicable only for bootable images.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_guest_os_features).

*   `imageEncryptionKey` -
    (Optional)
    Encrypts the image using a customer-supplied encryption key.
    After you encrypt an image with a customer-supplied key, you must
    provide the same key if you use the image later (e.g. to create a
    disk from the image)
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_image_encryption_key).

*   `labels` -
    (Optional)
    Labels to apply to this Image.

*   `licenses` -
    (Optional)
    Any applicable license URI.

*   `rawDisk` -
    (Optional)
    The parameters of the raw disk image.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_raw_disk).

*   `sourceDisk` -
    (Optional)
    The source disk to create this image based on.
    You must provide either this property or the
    rawDisk.source property but not both to create an image.

*   `sourceImage` -
    (Optional)
    URL of the source image used to create this image. In order to create an image, you must provide the full or partial
    URL of one of the following:
    * The selfLink URL
    * This property
    * The rawDisk.source URL
    * The sourceDisk URL

*   `sourceSnapshot` -
    (Optional)
    URL of the source snapshot used to create this image.
    In order to create an image, you must provide the full or partial URL of one of the following:
    * The selfLink URL
    * This property
    * The sourceImage URL
    * The rawDisk.source URL

    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

<a name="nested_guest_os_features"></a>The `guestOsFeatures` block supports:

    (Optional)
    The service account being used for the encryption request for the
    given KMS key. If absent, the Compute Engine default service
    account is used.

<a name="nested_raw_disk"></a>The `rawDisk` block supports:

*   `containerType` -
    (Optional)
    The format used to encode and transmit the block device, which
    should be TAR. This is just a container and transmission format
    and not a runtime format. Provided by the client when the disk
    image is created.
    Default value is `tar`.
    Possible values are `tar`.

*   `sha1` -
