# googleStorageDefaultObjectAcl

Authoritatively manages the default object ACLs for a Google Cloud Storage bucket
without managing the bucket itself.

\-> Note that for each object, its creator will have the `"owner"` role in addition
to the default ACL that has been defined.

For more information see
[the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/lists)
and
[API](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/defaultObjectAccessControls).

\-> Want fine-grained control over default object ACLs? Use `googleStorageDefaultObjectAccessControl`
to control individual role entity pairs.

## Example Usage

Example creating a default object ACL on a bucket with one owner, and one reader.

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const googleStorageBucketImageStore = new google.storageBucket.StorageBucket(
  this,
  "image-store",
  {
    location: "EU",
    name: "image-store-bucket",
  }
);
new google.storageDefaultObjectAcl.StorageDefaultObjectAcl(
  this,
  "image-store-default-acl",
  {
    bucket: googleStorageBucketImageStore.name,
    role_entity: ["OWNER:user-my.email@gmail.com", "READER:group-mygroup"],
  }
);

```
