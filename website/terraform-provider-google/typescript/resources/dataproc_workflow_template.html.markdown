# googleDataprocWorkflowTemplate

A Workflow Template is a reusable workflow configuration. It defines a graph of jobs with information on where to run those jobs.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/

*   `project` -
    (Optional)
    The project for the resource

    Optional. Used to perform a consistent read-modify-write. This field should be left blank for a `createWorkflowTemplate` request. It is required for an `updateWorkflowTemplate` request, and must match the current server version. A typical update template flow would fetch the current template with a `getWorkflowTemplate` request, which will return the current template with the `version` field filled in with the current server version. The user updates other fields in the template, then returns it as part of the `updateWorkflowTemplate` request.
