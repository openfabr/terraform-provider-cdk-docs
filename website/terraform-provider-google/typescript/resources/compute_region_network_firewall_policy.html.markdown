For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
new google.computeRegionNetworkFirewallPolicy.ComputeRegionNetworkFirewallPolicy(
  this,
  "primary",
  {
    description: "Sample regional network firewall policy",
    name: "policy",
    project: "my-project-name",
    region: "us-west1",
  }
);

```
