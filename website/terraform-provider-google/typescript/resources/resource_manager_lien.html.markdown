# googleResourceManagerLien

A Lien represents an encumbrance on the actions that can be performed on a resource.

## Example Usage - Resource Manager Lien

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const googleProjectProject = new google.project.Project(this, "project", {
  name: "A very important project!",
  project_id: "staging-project",
});
new google.resourceManagerLien.ResourceManagerLien(this, "lien", {
  origin: "machine-readable-explanation",
  parent: `projects/\${${googleProjectProject.number}}`,
  reason: "This project is an important environment",
  restrictions: ["resourcemanager.projects.delete"],
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `reason` -
    (Required)
    Concise user-visible strings indicating why an action cannot be performed
    on a resource. Maximum length of 200 characters.

*   `origin` -
    (Required)
    A stable, user-visible/meaningful string identifying the origin
    of the Lien, intended to be inspected programmatically. Maximum length of
    200 characters.

*   `parent` -
    (Required)
    A reference to the resource this Lien is attached to.
    The server will validate the parent against those for which Liens are supported.
    Since a variety of objects can have Liens against them, you must provide the type
    prefix (e.g. "projects/my-project-name").

*   `restrictions` -
    (Required)
    The types of operations which should be blocked as a result of this Lien.
    Each value should correspond to an IAM permission. The server will validate
    the permissions against those for which Liens are supported.  An empty
    list is meaningless and will be rejected.
    e.g. \['resourcemanager.projects.delete']

***

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

*   `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `{{name}}`

*   `name` -
    A system-generated unique identifier for this Lien.

*   `createTime` -
    Time of creation

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

* `create` - Default is 20 minutes.
* `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.
