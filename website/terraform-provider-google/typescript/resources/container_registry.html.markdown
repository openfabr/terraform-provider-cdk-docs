# googleContainerRegistry

Ensures that the Google Cloud Storage bucket that backs Google Container Registry exists. Creating this resource will create the backing bucket if it does not exist, or do nothing if the bucket already exists. Destroying this resource does *NOT* destroy the backing bucket. For more information see [the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/overview)

This resource can be used to ensure that the GCS bucket exists prior to assigning permissions. For more information see the [access control page](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/access-control) for GCR.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
new google.containerRegistry.ContainerRegistry(this, "registry", {
  location: "EU",
  project: "my-project",
});

```

The `id` field of the `googleContainerRegistry` is the identifier of the storage bucket that backs GCR and can be used to assign permissions to the bucket.

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const googleContainerRegistryRegistry =
  new google.containerRegistry.ContainerRegistry(this, "registry", {
    location: "EU",
    project: "my-project",
  });
new google.storageBucketIamMember.StorageBucketIamMember(this, "viewer", {
  bucket: googleContainerRegistryRegistry.id,
  member: "user:jane@example.com",
  role: "roles/storage.objectViewer",
});

```
