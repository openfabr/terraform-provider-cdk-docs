## Example Usage - Access Context Manager Authorized Orgs Desc Basic

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const googleAccessContextManagerAccessPolicyTestAccess =
  new google.accessContextManagerAccessPolicy.AccessContextManagerAccessPolicy(
    this,
    "test-access",
    {
      parent: "organizations/",
      title: "my policy",
    }
  );
new google.accessContextManagerAuthorizedOrgsDesc.AccessContextManagerAuthorizedOrgsDesc(
  this,
  "authorized-orgs-desc",
  {
    asset_type: "ASSET_TYPE_CREDENTIAL_STRENGTH",
    authorization_direction: "AUTHORIZATION_DIRECTION_TO",
    authorization_type: "AUTHORIZATION_TYPE_TRUST",
    name: `accessPolicies/\${${googleAccessContextManagerAccessPolicyTestAccess.name}}/authorizedOrgsDescs/fakeDescName`,
    orgs: ["organizations/12345", "organizations/98765"],
    parent: `accessPolicies/\${${googleAccessContextManagerAccessPolicyTestAccess.name}}`,
  }
);

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `parent` -
    (Required)
    Required. Resource name for the access policy which owns this `authorizedOrgsDesc`.

*   `name` -
    (Required)
    Resource name for the `authorizedOrgsDesc`. Format:
    `accessPolicies/{accessPolicy}/authorizedOrgsDescs/{authorizedOrgsDesc}`.
    The `authorizedOrgsDesc` component must begin with a letter, followed by
    alphanumeric characters or `_`.
    After you create an `authorizedOrgsDesc`, you cannot change its `name`.

***

*   `orgs` -
    (Optional)
    The list of organization ids in this AuthorizedOrgsDesc.
    Format: `organizations/<orgNumber>`
    Example: `organizations/123456`

*   `assetType` -
    (Optional)
    The type of entities that need to use the authorization relationship during
    evaluation, such as a device. Valid values are "ASSET\_TYPE\_DEVICE" and
    "ASSET\_TYPE\_CREDENTIAL\_STRENGTH".
    Possible values are `assetTypeDevice` and `assetTypeCredentialStrength`.

*   `authorizationDirection` -
    (Optional)
    The direction of the authorization relationship between this organization
    and the organizations listed in the "orgs" field. The valid values for this
    field include the following:
    AUTHORIZATION\_DIRECTION\_FROM: Allows this organization to evaluate traffic
    in the organizations listed in the `orgs` field.
    AUTHORIZATION\_DIRECTION\_TO: Allows the organizations listed in the `orgs`
    field to evaluate the traffic in this organization.
    For the authorization relationship to take effect, all of the organizations
    must authorize and specify the appropriate relationship direction. For
    example, if organization A authorized organization B and C to evaluate its
    traffic, by specifying "AUTHORIZATION\_DIRECTION\_TO" as the authorization
    direction, organizations B and C must specify
    "AUTHORIZATION\_DIRECTION\_FROM" as the authorization direction in their
    "AuthorizedOrgsDesc" resource.
    Possible values are `authorizationDirectionTo` and `authorizationDirectionFrom`.

*   `authorizationType` -
    (Optional)
    A granular control type for authorization levels. Valid value is "AUTHORIZATION\_TYPE\_TRUST".
    Possible values are `authorizationTypeTrust`.

*   `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `{{name}}`

*   `createTime` -
    Time the AuthorizedOrgsDesc was created in UTC.

*   `updateTime` -
    Time the AuthorizedOrgsDesc was updated in UTC.
