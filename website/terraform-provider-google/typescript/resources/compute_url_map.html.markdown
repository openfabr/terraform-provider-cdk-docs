## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The
  name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the
  name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression
  `[aZ]([AZ09]*[aZ09])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase
  letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit,
  except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

***

*   `defaultService` -
    (Optional)
    The backend service or backend bucket to use when none of the given rules match.

*   `description` -
    (Optional)
    An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create
    the resource.

*   `headerAction` -
    (Optional)
    Specifies changes to request and response headers that need to take effect for
    the selected backendService. The headerAction specified here take effect after
    headerAction specified under pathMatcher.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_header_action).

*   `hostRule` -
    (Optional)
    The list of HostRules to use against the URL.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_host_rule).

*   `pathMatcher` -
    (Optional)
    The list of named PathMatchers to use against the URL.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_path_matcher).

*   `test` -
    (Optional)
    The list of expected URL mapping tests. Request to update this UrlMap will
    succeed only if all of the test cases pass. You can specify a maximum of 100
    tests per UrlMap.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_test).

*   `defaultUrlRedirect` -
    (Optional)
    When none of the specified hostRules match, the request is redirected to a URL specified
    by defaultUrlRedirect. If defaultUrlRedirect is specified, defaultService or
    defaultRouteAction must not be set.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_default_url_redirect).

*   `defaultRouteAction` -
    (Optional)
    defaultRouteAction takes effect when none of the hostRules match. The load balancer performs advanced routing actions
    like URL rewrites, header transformations, etc. prior to forwarding the request to the selected backend.
    If defaultRouteAction specifies any weightedBackendServices, defaultService must not be set. Conversely if defaultService
    is set, defaultRouteAction cannot contain any weightedBackendServices.
    Only one of defaultRouteAction or defaultUrlRedirect must be set.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_default_route_action).

*   `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

<a name="nested_header_action"></a>The `headerAction` block supports:

*   `requestHeadersToAdd` -

    (Optional)
    Headers to add the response prior to sending the response back to the client.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_response_headers_to_add).

*   `responseHeadersToRemove` -
    (Optional)
    A list of header names for headers that need to be removed from the response
    prior to sending the response back to the client.

*   `headerName` -
    (Required)
    The name of the header.

*   `headerValue` -
    (Required)
    The value of the header to add.

*   `replace` -
    (Required)
    If false, headerValue is appended to any values that already exist for the
    header. If true, headerValue is set for the header, discarding any values that
    were set for that header.

<a name="nested_response_headers_to_add"></a>The `responseHeadersToAdd` block supports:

*   `headerName` -
    (Required)
    The name of the header.

*   `headerValue` -
    (Required)
    The value of the header to add.

*   `hosts` -
    (Required)
    The list of host patterns to match. They must be valid hostnames, except \* will
    match any string of (\[a-z0-9-.]\*). In that case, \* must be the first character
    and must be followed in the pattern by either - or ..

*   `pathMatcher` -
    (Required)
    The name of the PathMatcher to use to match the path portion of the URL if the
    hostRule matches the URL's host portion.

<a name="nested_path_matcher"></a>The `pathMatcher` block supports:

*   `defaultService` -
    (Optional)
    The backend service or backend bucket to use when none of the given paths match.

    the resource.

*   `headerAction` -
    (Optional)
    Specifies changes to request and response headers that need to take effect for

    (Optional)
    The list of path rules. Use this list instead of routeRules when routing based
    on simple path matching is all that's required. The order by which path rules
    are specified does not matter. Matches are always done on the longest-path-first
    basis. For example: a pathRule with a path /a/b/c/\* will match before /a/b/\*
    irrespective of the order in which those paths appear in this list. Within a
    given pathMatcher, only one of pathRules or routeRules must be set.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_path_rule).

*   `routeRules` -
    (Optional)
    The list of ordered HTTP route rules. Use this list instead of pathRules when
    advanced route matching and routing actions are desired. The order of specifying
    routeRules matters: the first rule that matches will cause its specified routing
    action to take effect. Within a given pathMatcher, only one of pathRules or
    routeRules must be set. routeRules are not supported in UrlMaps intended for
    External load balancers.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_route_rules).

*   `defaultUrlRedirect` -
    (Optional)
    When none of the specified hostRules match, the request is redirected to a URL specified
    by defaultUrlRedirect. If defaultUrlRedirect is specified, defaultService or
    defaultRouteAction must not be set.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_default_url_redirect).

*   `defaultRouteAction` -
    (Optional)
    defaultRouteAction takes effect when none of the pathRules or routeRules match. The load balancer performs
    advanced routing actions like URL rewrites, header transformations, etc. prior to forwarding the request
    to the selected backend. If defaultRouteAction specifies any weightedBackendServices, defaultService must not be set.
    Conversely if defaultService is set, defaultRouteAction cannot contain any weightedBackendServices.
    Only one of defaultRouteAction or defaultUrlRedirect must be set.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_default_route_action).

<a name="nested_header_action"></a>The `headerAction` block supports:

*   `requestHeadersToAdd` -
    (Optional)
    Headers to add to a matching request prior to forwarding the request to the
    backendService.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_request_headers_to_add).

*   `requestHeadersToRemove` -

    prior to forwarding the request to the backendService.

*   `responseHeadersToAdd` -
    (Optional)
    Headers to add the response prior to sending the response back to the client.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_response_headers_to_add).

*   `responseHeadersToRemove` -
    (Optional)
    A list of header names for headers that need to be removed from the response
    prior to sending the response back to the client.

<a name="nested_request_headers_to_add"></a>The `requestHeadersToAdd` block supports:

*   `headerName` -
    (Required)
    The name of the header.

*   `headerValue` -
    (Required)
    The value of the header to add.

*   `replace` -
    (Required)
    If false, headerValue is appended to any values that already exist for the
    header. If true, headerValue is set for the header, discarding any values that
    were set for that header.

<a name="nested_response_headers_to_add"></a>The `responseHeadersToAdd` block supports:

*   `headerName` -
    (Required)
    The name of the header.

*   `headerValue` -
    (Required)
    The value of the header to add.

    does not include any text after the first ? or #, and those chars are not
    allowed here.

*   `routeAction` -
    (Optional)
    In response to a matching path, the load balancer performs advanced routing
    actions like URL rewrites, header transformations, etc. prior to forwarding the
    request to the selected backend. If routeAction specifies any
    weightedBackendServices, service must not be set. Conversely if service is set,
    routeAction cannot contain any  weightedBackendServices. Only one of routeAction
    or urlRedirect must be set.

    backend service. Similarly requests from clients can be aborted by the
    Loadbalancer for a percentage of requests. timeout and retry\_policy will be
    ignored by clients that are configured with a fault\_injection\_policy.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_fault_injection_policy).

*   `requestMirrorPolicy` -
    (Optional)
    Specifies the policy on how requests intended for the route's backends are
    shadowed to a separate mirrored backend service. Loadbalancer does not wait for

    backend service. Similarly requests from clients can be aborted by the
    Loadbalancer for a percentage of requests. timeout and retry\_policy will be
    ignored by clients that are configured with a fault\_injection\_policy.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_fault_injection_policy).

*   `requestMirrorPolicy` -
    (Optional)
    Specifies the policy on how requests intended for the route's backends are
    shadowed to a separate mirrored backend service. Loadbalancer does not wait for
    responses from the shadow service. Prior to sending traffic to the shadow
    service, the host / authority header is suffixed with -shadow.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_request_mirror_policy).

*   `retryPolicy` -
    (Optional)
    Specifies the retry policy associated with this route.

    number. Once a backendService is identified and before forwarding the request to
    the backend service, advanced routing actions like Url rewrites and header
    transformations are applied depending on additional settings specified in this
