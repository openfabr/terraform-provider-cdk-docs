    (Required)
    Resource name.

    (Required)
    Required. List of OS policies to be applied to the VMs.

*   `rollout` -
    (Required)

A rollout is triggered in the following situations: 1) OSPolicyAssignment is created. 2) OSPolicyAssignment is updated and the update contains changes to one of the following fields: - instance\_filter - os\_policies 3) OSPolicyAssignment is deleted.

The `instanceFilter` block supports:

    (Optional)
    Target all VMs in the project. If true, no other criteria is permitted.

*   `exclusionLabels` -

    (Optional)
    List of label sets used for VM inclusion. If the list has more than one `labelSet`, the VM is included if any of the label sets are applicable for the VM.

*   `inventories` -
    (Optional)
