# googleSccNotificationConfig

A Cloud Security Command Center (Cloud SCC) notification configs. A
notification config is a Cloud SCC resource that contains the
configuration to send notifications for create/update events of
findings, assets and etc.
\~> **Note:** In order to use Cloud SCC resources, your organization must be enrolled
in [SCC Standard/Premium](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/quickstart-security-command-center).
Without doing so, you may run into errors during resource creation.

To get more information about NotificationConfig, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/reference/rest/v1/organizations.notificationConfigs)

## Example Usage - Scc Notification Config Basic

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.

import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const googlePubsubTopicSccNotification = new google.pubsubTopic.PubsubTopic(
  this,
  "scc_notification",
  {
    name: "my-topic",
  }

new google.sccNotificationConfig.SccNotificationConfig(

    streaming_config: [
      {
        filter: 'category = "OPEN_FIREWALL" AND state = "ACTIVE"',
      },
    ],
