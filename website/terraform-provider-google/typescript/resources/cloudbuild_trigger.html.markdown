***

*   `name` -
    (Optional)
    Name of the trigger. Must be unique within the project.

*   `description` -
    (Optional)
    Human-readable description of the trigger.

*   `tags` -
    (Optional)
    Tags for annotation of a BuildTrigger

*   `disabled` -
    (Optional)
    Whether the trigger is disabled or not. If true, the trigger will never result in a build.

*   `substitutions` -
    (Optional)
    Substitutions data for Build resource.

*   `serviceAccount` -
    (Optional)
    The service account used for all user-controlled operations including
    triggers.patch, triggers.run, builds.create, and builds.cancel.
    If no service account is set, then the standard Cloud Build service account
    (\[PROJECT\_NUM]@system.gserviceaccount.com) will be used instead.
    Format: projects/{PROJECT\_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT\_ID\_OR\_EMAIL}

*   `includeBuildLogs` -
    (Optional)
    Build logs will be sent back to GitHub as part of the checkrun
    result.  Values can be INCLUDE\_BUILD\_LOGS\_UNSPECIFIED or
    INCLUDE\_BUILD\_LOGS\_WITH\_STATUS
    Possible values are `includeBuildLogsUnspecified` and `includeBuildLogsWithStatus`.

*   `filename` -
    (Optional)
    Path, from the source root, to a file whose contents is used for the template.
    Either a filename or build template must be provided. Set this only when using trigger\_template or github.
    When using Pub/Sub, Webhook or Manual set the file name using git\_file\_source instead.

*   `filter` -
    (Optional)
    A Common Expression Language string. Used only with Pub/Sub and Webhook.

*   `gitFileSource` -
    (Optional)
    The file source describing the local or remote Build template.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_git_file_source).

*   `repositoryEventConfig` -
    (Optional, [Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html))
    The configuration of a trigger that creates a build whenever an event from Repo API is received.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_repository_event_config).

*   `sourceToBuild` -
    (Optional)
    The repo and ref of the repository from which to build.
    This field is used only for those triggers that do not respond to SCM events.
    Triggers that respond to such events build source at whatever commit caused the event.
    This field is currently only used by Webhook, Pub/Sub, Manual, and Cron triggers.
    One of `triggerTemplate`, `github`, `pubsubConfig` `webhookConfig` or `sourceToBuild` must be provided.

*   `ignoredFiles` -
    (Optional)
    ignoredFiles and includedFiles are file glob matches using https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Match
    extended with support for `**`.
    If ignoredFiles and changed files are both empty, then they are not
    used to determine whether or not to trigger a build.
    If ignoredFiles is not empty, then we ignore any files that match any
    of the ignored\_file globs. If the change has no files that are outside
    of the ignoredFiles globs, then we do not trigger a build.

*   `includedFiles` -
    (Optional)
    ignoredFiles and includedFiles are file glob matches using https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Match
    extended with support for `**`.
    If any of the files altered in the commit pass the ignoredFiles filter
    and includedFiles is empty, then as far as this filter is concerned, we
    should trigger the build.
    If any of the files altered in the commit pass the ignoredFiles filter
    and includedFiles is not empty, then we make sure that at least one of
    those files matches a includedFiles glob. If not, then we do not trigger
    a build.

*   `triggerTemplate` -
    (Optional)
    Template describing the types of source changes to trigger a build.
    Branch and tag names in trigger templates are interpreted as regular
    expressions. Any branch or tag change that matches that regular
    expression will trigger a build.

    the officially supported build steps (see https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders
    for images and examples).
    The Docker daemon will also have cached many of the layers for some popular
    images, like "ubuntu", "debian", but they will be refreshed at the time
    you attempt to use them.
    If you built an image in a previous build step, it will be stored in the
    host's Docker daemon's cache and is available to use as the name for a
    later build step.

*   `args` -
    (Optional)
    A list of arguments that will be presented to the step when it is started.
    If the image used to run the step's container has an entrypoint, the args
    are used as arguments to that entrypoint. If the image does not define an
    entrypoint, the first element in args is used as the entrypoint, and the
    remainder will be used as arguments.

*   `env` -
    (Optional)
    A list of environment variable definitions to be used when
    running a step.
    The elements are of the form "KEY=VALUE" for the environment variable
    "KEY" being given the value "VALUE".

*   `id` -
    (Optional)
    Unique identifier for this build step, used in `waitFor` to
    reference this build step as a dependency.

*   `entrypoint` -
    (Optional)
    Entrypoint to be used instead of the build step image's
    default entrypoint.
    If unset, the image's default entrypoint is used

*   `dir` -
    (Optional)
    Working directory to use when running this step's container.
    If this value is a relative path, it is relative to the build's working
    directory. If this value is absolute, it may be outside the build's working
    directory, in which case the contents of the path may not be persisted
    across build step executions, unless a `volume` for that path is specified.
    If the build specifies a `repoSource` with `dir` and a step with a
    `dir`,
    which specifies an absolute path, the `repoSource` `dir` is ignored
    for the step's execution.

*   `secretEnv` -
    (Optional)
    A list of environment variables which are encrypted using
    a Cloud Key
    Management Service crypto key. These values must be specified in
    the build's `secret`.

*   `timeout` -
    (Optional)
    Time limit for executing this build step. If not defined,
    the step has no
    time limit and will be allowed to continue to run until either it
    completes or the build itself times out.

*   `timing` -
    (Optional)
    Output only. Stores timing information for executing this
    build step.

*   `volumes` -
    (Optional)
    List of volumes to mount into the build step.
    Each volume is created as an empty volume prior to execution of the
    build step. Upon completion of the build, volumes and their contents
    are discarded.
    Using a named volume in only one step is not valid as it is
    indicative of a build request with an incorrect configuration.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_volumes).

*   `waitFor` -
    (Optional)
    The ID(s) of the step(s) that this build step depends on.
    This build step will not start until all the build steps in `waitFor`
    have completed successfully. If `waitFor` is empty, this build step
    will start when all previous build steps in the `buildSteps` list
    have completed successfully.

*   `script` -
    (Optional)
    A shell script to be executed in the step.
    When script is provided, the user cannot specify the entrypoint or args.

<a name="nested_volumes"></a>The `volumes` block supports:

*   `name` -
    (Required)
    Name of the volume to mount.
    Volume names must be unique per build step and must be valid names for
    Docker volumes. Each named volume must be used by at least two build steps.

*   `path` -
    (Required)
    Path at which to mount the volume.
    Paths must be absolute and cannot conflict with other volume paths on
    the same build step or with certain reserved volume paths.

<a name="nested_artifacts"></a>The `artifacts` block supports:

*   `images` -
    (Optional)
    A list of images to be pushed upon the successful completion of all build steps.
    The images will be pushed using the builder service account's credentials.
    The digests of the pushed images will be stored in the Build resource's results field.
    If any of the images fail to be pushed, the build is marked FAILURE.

*   `objects` -
    (Optional)
    A list of objects to be uploaded to Cloud Storage upon successful completion of all build steps.
    Files in the workspace matching specified paths globs will be uploaded to the
    Cloud Storage location using the builder service account's credentials.
    The location and generation of the uploaded objects will be stored in the Build resource's results field.
    If any objects fail to be pushed, the build is marked FAILURE.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_objects).

<a name="nested_objects"></a>The `objects` block supports:

*   `location` -
    (Optional)
    Cloud Storage bucket and optional object path, in the form "gs://bucket/path/to/somewhere/".
    Files in the workspace matching any path pattern will be uploaded to Cloud Storage with
    this location as a prefix.

*   `paths` -
    (Optional)
    Path globs used to match files in the build's workspace.

*   `timing` -
    (Output)
    Output only. Stores timing information for pushing all artifact objects.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_timing).

<a name="nested_timing"></a>The `timing` block contains:

*   `startTime` -
    (Optional)
    Start of time span.
    A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, with nanosecond resolution and up to
    nine fractional digits. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" and "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z".

*   `endTime` -
    (Optional)
    End of time span.
    A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, with nanosecond resolution and up to
    nine fractional digits. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" and "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z".

<a name="nested_options"></a>The `options` block supports:

*   `sourceProvenanceHash` -
    (Optional)
    Requested hash for SourceProvenance.
    Each value may be one of `none`, `sha256`, and `md5`.

*   `requestedVerifyOption` -
    (Optional)
    Requested verifiability options.
    Possible values are `notVerified` and `verified`.

*   `diskSizeGb` -
    (Optional)
    Requested disk size for the VM that runs the build. Note that this is NOT "disk free";
    some of the space will be used by the operating system and build utilities.
    Also note that this is the minimum disk size that will be allocated for the build --
    the build may run with a larger disk than requested. At present, the maximum disk size
    is 1000GB; builds that request more than the maximum are rejected with an error.

*   `substitutionOption` -
    (Optional)
    Option to specify behavior when there is an error in the substitution checks.
    NOTE this is always set to ALLOW\_LOOSE for triggered builds and cannot be overridden
    in the build configuration file.
    Possible values are `mustMatch` and `allowLoose`.

*   `dynamicSubstitutions` -
    (Optional)
    Option to specify whether or not to apply bash style string operations to the substitutions.
    NOTE this is always enabled for triggered builds and cannot be overridden in the build configuration file.

*   `logStreamingOption` -
    (Optional)
    Option to define build log streaming behavior to Google Cloud Storage.
    Possible values are `streamDefault`, `streamOn`, and `streamOff`.

*   `workerPool` -

    This field is experimental.

*   `logging` -
    (Optional)
    Option to specify the logging mode, which determines if and where build logs are stored.

*   `env` -
    (Optional)
    A list of global environment variable definitions that will exist for all build steps
    in this build. If a variable is defined in both globally and in a build step,
    the variable will use the build step value.
    The elements are of the form "KEY=VALUE" for the environment variable "KEY" being given the value "VALUE".

*   `secretEnv` -
    (Optional)
    A list of global environment variables, which are encrypted using a Cloud Key Management
    Service crypto key. These values must be specified in the build's Secret. These variables
    will be available to all build steps in this build.

*   `volumes` -
    (Optional)
    Global list of volumes to mount for ALL build steps
    Each volume is created as an empty volume prior to starting the build process.
    Upon completion of the build, volumes and their contents are discarded. Global
    volume names and paths cannot conflict with the volumes defined a build step.
    Using a global volume in a build with only one step is not valid as it is indicative
    of a build request with an incorrect configuration.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_volumes).

<a name="nested_volumes"></a>The `volumes` block supports:

*   `name` -
    (Optional)
    Name of the volume to mount.

    Each named volume must be used by at least two build steps.

*   `path` -
    (Optional)
    Path at which to mount the volume.
    Paths must be absolute and cannot conflict with other volume paths on the same
    build step or with certain reserved volume paths.
