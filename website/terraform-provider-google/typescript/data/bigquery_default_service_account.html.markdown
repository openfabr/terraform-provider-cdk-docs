# googleBigqueryDefaultServiceAccount

Get the email address of a project's unique BigQuery service account.

Each Google Cloud project has a unique service account used by BigQuery. When using
BigQuery with [customer-managed encryption keys](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/customer-managed-encryption),
this account needs to be granted the
`cloudkmsCryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter` IAM role on the customer-managed Cloud KMS key used to protect the data.

For more information see
[the API reference](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/projects/getServiceAccount).

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.

import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.

const dataGoogleBigqueryDefaultServiceAccountBqSa =
  new google.dataGoogleBigqueryDefaultServiceAccount.DataGoogleBigqueryDefaultServiceAccount(
    this,
    "bq_sa",
    {}
  );
new google.kmsCryptoKeyIamMember.KmsCryptoKeyIamMember(this, "key_sa_user", {
