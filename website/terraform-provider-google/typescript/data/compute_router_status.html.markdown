# googleComputeRouterStatus

Get a Cloud Router's status within GCE from its name and region. This data source exposes the
routes learned by a Cloud Router via BGP peers.

For more information see [the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/router/how-to/viewing-router-details)
and
[API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/routers/getRouterStatus).

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
new google.dataGoogleComputeRouterStatus.DataGoogleComputeRouterStatus(
  this,
  "my-router",
  {
    name: "myrouter",
  }
);

```
