# googleContainerRegistryRepository

This data source fetches the project name, and provides the appropriate URLs to use for container registry for this project.

The URLs are computed entirely offline - as long as the project exists, they will be valid, but this data source does not contact Google Container Registry (GCR) at any point.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const dataGoogleContainerRegistryRepositoryFoo =
  new google.dataGoogleContainerRegistryRepository.DataGoogleContainerRegistryRepository(
    this,
    "foo",
    {}
  );
new cdktf.TerraformOutput(this, "gcr_location", {
  value: dataGoogleContainerRegistryRepositoryFoo.repositoryUrl,
});

```

## Argument Reference

* `project`: (Optional) The project ID that this repository is attached to.  If not provided, provider project will be used instead.
* `region`: (Optional) The GCR region to use.  As of this writing, one of `asia`, `eu`, and `us`.  See [the documentation](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/pushing-and-pulling) for additional information.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, this data source exports:

* `repositoryUrl`: The URL at which the repository can be accessed.
