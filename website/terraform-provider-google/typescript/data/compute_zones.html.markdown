# googleComputeZones

Provides access to available Google Compute zones in a region for a given project.
See more about [regions and zones](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/regions-zones) in the upstream docs.

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const dataGoogleComputeZonesAvailable =
  new google.dataGoogleComputeZones.DataGoogleComputeZones(
    this,
    "available",
    {}
  );
const googleComputeInstanceGroupManagerFoo =
  new google.computeInstanceGroupManager.ComputeInstanceGroupManager(
    this,
    "foo",
    {
      base_instance_name: "foobar-${count.index}",
      instance_template: "${google_compute_instance_template.foobar.self_link}",
      name: "terraform-test-${count.index}",
      target_size: 1,
      zone: `\${${dataGoogleComputeZonesAvailable.names.fqn}[count.index]}`,
    }
  );
/*In most cases loops should be handled in the programming language context and 
not inside of the Terraform context. If you are looping over something external, e.g. a variable or a file input
you should consider using a for loop. If you are looping over something only known to Terraform, e.g. a result of a data source
you need to keep this like it is.*/
googleComputeInstanceGroupManagerFoo.addOverride(
  "count",
  `\${length(${dataGoogleComputeZonesAvailable.names})}`
);

```
