# googleServiceAccountJwt

This data source provides a [self-signed JWT](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/create-short-lived-credentials-direct#sa-credentials-jwt).  Tokens issued from this data source are typically used to call external services that accept JWTs for authentication.

## Example Usage

Note: in order to use the following, the caller must have *at least* `roles/iamServiceAccountTokenCreator` on the `targetServiceAccount`.

```typescript
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const dataGoogleServiceAccountJwtFoo =
  new google.dataGoogleServiceAccountJwt.DataGoogleServiceAccountJwt(
    this,
    "foo",
    {
      expires_in: 60,
      payload: '${jsonencode({\n    foo: "bar",\n    sub: "subject",\n  })}',
      target_service_account:
        "impersonated-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
    }
  );
new cdktf.TerraformOutput(this, "jwt", {
  value: dataGoogleServiceAccountJwtFoo.jwt,
});

```

## Argument Reference

* `targetServiceAccount` (Required) - The email of the service account that will sign the JWT.
* `payload` (Required) - The JSON-encoded JWT claims set to include in the self-signed JWT.
* `expiresIn` (Optional) - Number of seconds until the JWT expires. If set and non-zero an `exp` claim will be added to the payload derived from the current timestamp plus expires\_in seconds.
* `delegates` (Optional) - Delegate chain of approvals needed to perform full impersonation. Specify the fully qualified service account name.

## Attributes Reference

The following attribute is exported:

* `jwt` - The signed JWT containing the JWT Claims Set from the `payload`.
