# googleSecretManagerSecretVersion

Get the value and metadata from a Secret Manager secret version. For more information see the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/) and [API](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.secrets.versions). If you don't need the metadata (i.e., if you want to use a more limited role to access the secret version only), see also the [google\_secret\_manager\_secret\_version\_access](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/data-sources/secret_manager_secret_version_access) datasource.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: google.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
new google.dataGoogleSecretManagerSecretVersion.DataGoogleSecretManagerSecretVersion(
  this,
  "basic",
  {
    secret: "my-secret",
  }
);

```
