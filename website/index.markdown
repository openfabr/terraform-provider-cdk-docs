# Terraform Provider Docs for CDK

Terrform Provider CDK docs for TypeScript, Python, Java, and CSharp. They are auto generated from the respective providers HCL docs. The HCL code block conversion is handled by using @cdktf/hcl2cdk which is the library used by the CDKTF CLI Convert command.

We can't promise that the code references are 100% accurate. The converter library has several cases it doesn't support yet. But Hashicorp are actively improving the converter.
