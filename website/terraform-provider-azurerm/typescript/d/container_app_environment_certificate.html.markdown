## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.

import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const dataAzurermContainerAppEnvironmentExample =
  new azurerm.dataAzurermContainerAppEnvironment.DataAzurermContainerAppEnvironment(
    this,
    "example",
    {
      name: "example-environment",
      resource_group_name: "example-resources",
    }
  );
const dataAzurermContainerAppEnvironmentCertificateExample =
  new azurerm.dataAzurermContainerAppEnvironmentCertificate.DataAzurermContainerAppEnvironmentCertificate(
    this,
    "example_1",
    {
      container_app_environment_id:
        dataAzurermContainerAppEnvironmentExample.id,
      name: "mycertificate",

/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
dataAzurermContainerAppEnvironmentCertificateExample.overrideLogicalId(
  "example"
