/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/

    name: "mykeyvault",
    resource_group_name: "some-resource-group",
  });
const dataAzurermKeyVaultCertificateIssuerExample =

    {
      key_vault_id: dataAzurermKeyVaultExample.id,
