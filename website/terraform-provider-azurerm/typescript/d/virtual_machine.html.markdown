# Data Source: azurerm\_virtual\_machine

Use this data source to access information about an existing Virtual Machine.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
new azurerm.provider.AzurermProvider(this, "azurerm", {
  features: [{}],
});
const dataAzurermVirtualMachineExample =
  new azurerm.dataAzurermVirtualMachine.DataAzurermVirtualMachine(
    this,
    "example",
    {
      name: "production",
      resource_group_name: "networking",
    }
  );
new cdktf.TerraformOutput(this, "virtual_machine_id", {
  value: dataAzurermVirtualMachineExample.id,
});

```

## Argument Reference
