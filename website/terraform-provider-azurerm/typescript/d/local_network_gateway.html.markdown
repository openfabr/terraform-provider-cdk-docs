For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const dataAzurermLocalNetworkGatewayExample =
  new azurerm.dataAzurermLocalNetworkGateway.DataAzurermLocalNetworkGateway(
    this,
    "example",
    {
      name: "existing-local-network-gateway",
      resource_group_name: "existing-resources",
