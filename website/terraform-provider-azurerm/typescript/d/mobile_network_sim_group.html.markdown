import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const dataAzurermMobileNetworkExample =
  new azurerm.dataAzurermMobileNetwork.DataAzurermMobileNetwork(
    this,
    "example",
    {
      name: "example-mn",
      resource_group_name: "${azurerm_resource_group.example.name}",
    }
  );
const dataAzurermMobileNetworkSimGroupExample =
  new azurerm.dataAzurermMobileNetworkSimGroup.DataAzurermMobileNetworkSimGroup(
    this,
    "example_1",
    {
      mobile_network_id: dataAzurermMobileNetworkExample.id,
      name: "example-mnsg",
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
dataAzurermMobileNetworkSimGroupExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
