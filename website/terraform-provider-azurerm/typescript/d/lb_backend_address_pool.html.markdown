  Get information about an existing Load Balancer Backend Address Pool

# Data Source: azurerm\_lb\_backend\_address\_pool

Use this data source to access information about an existing Load Balancer's Backend Address Pool.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
new cdktf.TerraformOutput(this, "backend_ip_configuration_ids", {
  value:
    "${data.azurerm_lb_backend_address_pool.beap.backend_ip_configurations.*.id}",
});
const dataAzurermLbExample = new azurerm.dataAzurermLb.DataAzurermLb(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    name: "example-lb",
    resource_group_name: "example-resources",
  }
);
const dataAzurermLbBackendAddressPoolExample =
  new azurerm.dataAzurermLbBackendAddressPool.DataAzurermLbBackendAddressPool(
    this,
    "example_2",
    {
      loadbalancer_id: dataAzurermLbExample.id,
      name: "first",
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
dataAzurermLbBackendAddressPoolExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
new cdktf.TerraformOutput(this, "backend_address_pool_id", {
  value: dataAzurermLbBackendAddressPoolExample.id,
});

```

## Argument Reference

*   `name` - Specifies the name of the Backend Address Pool.

*   `loadbalancerId` - The ID of the Load Balancer in which the Backend Address Pool exists.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

*   `id` - The ID of the Backend Address Pool.

*   `name` - The name of the Backend Address Pool.

*   `backendAddress` - A list of `backendAddress` block as defined below.

*   `backendIpConfigurations` - A list of references to IP addresses defined in network interfaces.

*   `loadBalancingRules` - A list of the Load Balancing Rules associated with this Backend Address Pool.

*   `inboundNatRules` - A list of the Load Balancing Inbound NAT Rules associated with this Backend Address Pool.

*   `outboundRules` - A list of the Load Balancing Outbound Rules associated with this Backend Address Pool.

***

A `backendAddress` block exports the following:

*   `name` - The name of the Backend Address.

*   `virtualNetworkId` - The ID of the Virtual Network where the Backend Address of the Load Balancer exists.

*   `ipAddress` - The Static IP address for this Load Balancer within the Virtual Network.

*   `inboundNatRulePortMapping` - A list of `inboundNatRulePortMapping` block as defined below.

***

A `inboundNatRulePortMapping` block exports the following:

*   `inboundNatRuleName` - The name of the Load Balancing Inbound NAT Rules associated with this Backend Address Pool Address.

*   `frontendPort` - The Frontend Port of the Load Balancing Inbound NAT Rules associated with this Backend Address Pool Address.

*   `backendPort` - The Backend Port of the Load Balancing Inbound NAT Rules associated with this Backend Address Pool Address.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Backend Address Pool.
