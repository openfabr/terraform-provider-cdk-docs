## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const dataAzurermApiManagementExample =
  new azurerm.dataAzurermApiManagement.DataAzurermApiManagement(
    this,
    "example",
    {
      name: "example-apim",
      resource_group_name: "example-rg",
    }
  );
const dataAzurermApiManagementGatewayExample =
  new azurerm.dataAzurermApiManagementGateway.DataAzurermApiManagementGateway(
    this,

    {
      api_management_id: dataAzurermApiManagementExample.id,
