# Data Source: azurerm\_storage\_management\_policy

Use this data source to access information about an existing Storage Management Policy.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const dataAzurermStorageAccountExample =
  new azurerm.dataAzurermStorageAccount.DataAzurermStorageAccount(
    this,
    "example",
    {
      name: "storageaccountname",
      resource_group_name: "resourcegroupname",
    }
  );
const dataAzurermStorageManagementPolicyExample =
  new azurerm.dataAzurermStorageManagementPolicy.DataAzurermStorageManagementPolicy(
    this,
    "example_1",
    {
      storage_account_id: dataAzurermStorageAccountExample.id,
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
dataAzurermStorageManagementPolicyExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `storageAccountId` - Specifies the id of the storage account to retrieve the management policy for.

## Attributes Reference

* `id` - The ID of the Management Policy.
* `rule` - A `rule` block as documented below.

***

*   `rule` supports the following:

*   `name` - A rule name can contain any combination of alpha numeric characters. Rule name is case-sensitive. It must be unique within a policy.

*   `enabled` -  Boolean to specify whether the rule is enabled.

*   `filters` - A `filter` block as documented below.

*   `actions` - An `actions` block as documented below.

***

`filters` supports the following:

* `prefixMatch` - An array of strings for prefixes to be matched.
* `blobTypes` - An array of predefined values. Valid options are `blockBlob` and `appendBlob`.
* `matchBlobIndexTag` - A `matchBlobIndexTag` block as defined below. The block defines the blob index tag based filtering for blob objects.

***

`actions` supports the following:

* `baseBlob` - A `baseBlob` block as documented below.
* `snapshot` - A `snapshot` block as documented below.
* `version` - A `version` block as documented below.

***

`baseBlob` supports the following:

* `tierToCoolAfterDaysSinceModificationGreaterThan` - The age in days after last modification to tier blobs to cool storage. Supports blob currently at Hot tier.
* `tierToCoolAfterDaysSinceLastAccessTimeGreaterThan` - The age in days after last access time to tier blobs to cool storage. Supports blob currently at Hot tier.
* `tierToArchiveAfterDaysSinceModificationGreaterThan` - The age in days after last modification to tier blobs to archive storage. Supports blob currently at Hot or Cool tier.
* `tierToArchiveAfterDaysSinceLastAccessTimeGreaterThan` - The age in days after last access time to tier blobs to archive storage. Supports blob currently at Hot or Cool tier.
* `tierToArchiveAfterDaysSinceLastTierChangeGreaterThan` - The age in days after last tier change to the blobs to skip to be archived.
* `deleteAfterDaysSinceModificationGreaterThan` - The age in days after last modification to delete the blob.
* `deleteAfterDaysSinceLastAccessTimeGreaterThan` - The age in days after last access time to delete the blob.

***

`snapshot` supports the following:

* `changeTierToArchiveAfterDaysSinceCreation` - The age in days after creation to tier blob snapshot to archive storage.
* `tierToArchiveAfterDaysSinceLastTierChangeGreaterThan` - The age in days after last tier change to the blobs to skip to be archived.
* `changeTierToCoolAfterDaysSinceCreation` - The age in days after creation to tier blob snapshot to cool storage.
* `deleteAfterDaysSinceCreationGreaterThan` - The age in days after creation to delete the blob snapshot.

***

`version` supports the following:

* `changeTierToArchiveAfterDaysSinceCreation` - The age in days after creation to tier blob version to archive storage.
* `tierToArchiveAfterDaysSinceLastTierChangeGreaterThan` - The age in days after last tier change to the blobs to skip to be archived.
* `changeTierToCoolAfterDaysSinceCreation` - The age in days after creation to tier blob version to cool storage.
* `deleteAfterDaysSinceCreation` - The age in days after creation to delete the blob version.

***

`matchBlobIndexTag` supports the following:

* `name` - The filter tag name used for tag based filtering for blob objects.
* `operation` - The comparison operator which is used for object comparison and filtering. Possible value is `==`. Defaults to `==`.
* `value` -  The filter tag value used for tag based filtering for blob objects.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Storage Management Policy.
