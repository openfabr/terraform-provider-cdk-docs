# AzureRM Provider

## AzureRM Provider Version v3.0

The last major release for the AzureRM provider was in February 2020. Since then we've added support for nearly 400 Resources and 100 Data Sources, bringing the total supported features to 761 Resources and 238 Data Sources at the time of writing this guide.

### Considerations

Version 3.0 of the AzureRM Provider is a major release and as such includes some larger-scale changes which are outlined in this document.

When upgrading to v3.0 of the AzureRM Provider, we recommend upgrading to the latest version of Terraform Core ([which can be found here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)) - the next major release of the AzureRM Provider (v4.0) will require Terraform 1.0 or later.

If you're using [the AzureRM Backend](https://www.terraform.io/language/settings/backends/azurerm) you should also be aware that:

* Version 1.1 of Terraform Core introduces support for Microsoft Graph (MSAL) authentication - although this is disabled by default and needs to be enabled using a feature flag (`useMicrosoftGraph =True`), otherwise Azure Active Directory (ADAL) authentication is used.
* In the future version 1.2 of Terraform Core will switch to using Microsoft Graph (MSAL) authentication by default (changing the default value of the feature flag `useMicrosoftGraph` from `false` to `true`) - however note that this feature-flag will be removed in a future release of Terraform Core.

### Pinning your Provider Version

We recommend pinning the version of each Provider you use in Terraform - you can do this using the `version` attribute within the `requiredProviders` block, either to a specific version of the AzureRM Provider, like so:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: hashicorp/azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
new azurerm.provider.AzurermProvider(this, "azurerm", {
  features: [{}],
});

```

.. or to any 2.x release:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: hashicorp/azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
new azurerm.provider.AzurermProvider(this, "azurerm", {
  features: [{}],
});

```

More information on [how to pin the version of a Terraform Provider being used can be found on the Terraform Website](https://www.terraform.io/language/providers/requirements#requiring-providers).

***

## What's available in Version 3.0 of the AzureRM Provider?

\-> **Note:** Version `2970`-`2990` of the Azure Provider allow you to opt-into the Beta of these features - [see the Beta guide for more information](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/2.97.0/docs/guides/3.0-beta)

At a high level, version 3.0 includes the following changes:

* [New Data Sources and Resources for App Service and Function Apps](#new-resources-and-data-sources-for-app-service)
* [Soft Delete Recovery/Purging for Certificates, Keys, and Secrets](#soft-delete-for-key-vault)
* [Switching to Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)](#switching-to-msal)
* [Updates to existing behaviors for Application Gateway, API Management, Resource Groups, Storage, among others](#behavioural-updates)
* [Removal of Deprecated Fields, Data Sources, and Resources](#removal-of-deprecated-fields-data-sources-and-resources)

Each of these topics is covered in more detail below.

## New Resources and Data Sources for App Service

While itâ€™s possible to provision App Services and Function Apps in Terraform today, the design and behaviour of the App Service platform has evolved over the years. These resources require some refinement.

Similar to the changes for Virtual Machines in v2.0 of the Azure Provider, we've introduced more granular resources for App Service to better represent the functionality available in Azure.  This is most noticeable in the separation of some resources into Linux and Windows variants. This separation is intended to facilitate improved validation and more intuitive configuration for their differing requirements and capabilities, which could previously be unclear or confusing in the respective singular resources.

The following new **Data Sources** will be available:

* [azurerm\_linux\_function\_app](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/data-sources/linux_function_app)
* [azurerm\_linux\_web\_app](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/data-sources/linux_web_app)

## Migrating to New & Renamed Resources

When migrating to the new version of deprecated resources the schema may be different than what currently exists in state. Therefore, it is recommended to first update your terraform configuration with the new resource, use `terraformStateRm`, and then `terraformImport`.

A guide on how to do this can be found in the [Migrating from Deprecated Resources Guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/guides/migrating-from-deprecated-resources) and a tutorial for `terraformImport` can be found [here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/state-import)

## Soft Delete for Key Vault

Previously, soft delete has only been available for a Key Vault resource as a whole. Now, youâ€™ll be able to soft delete the nested items within a Key Vault: certificates, keys, and secrets.

This can be configured in the `features` block like so:

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
new azurerm.provider.AzurermProvider(this, "azurerm", {
  features: [
    {
      key_vault: [
        {
          purge_soft_delete_on_destroy: true,
          purge_soft_deleted_certificates_on_destroy: true,
          purge_soft_deleted_keys_on_destroy: true,
          purge_soft_deleted_secrets_on_destroy: true,
          recover_soft_deleted_certificates: true,
          recover_soft_deleted_key_vaults: true,
          recover_soft_deleted_keys: true,
          recover_soft_deleted_secrets: true,
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});

```

The default value is `true` for each of the above feature flags, and they can be toggled off by explicitly setting them to `false`. For more information, please refer to the [Features Block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/Azurerm/latest/docs/guides/features-block) documentation.

## Switching to MSAL

Authentication to APIs such as Resource Manager was previously performed using the ADAL library which yielded legacy v1 authentication tokens. In version 3.0 of the provider we've moved to use [v2 tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens#v10-and-v20). In practice this change will not yield any noticeable behavioral differences.

## Behavioural updates

**All Resources:** The Resource ID will now be validated at import time to ensure the correct resource is being imported, and return the expected format upon a mismatch. This ensures that, for example, a Virtual Machine ID is specified rather than the VM Extension ID (which is nested under a Virtual Machine ID).

**Resources with a `minTlsVersion` field:** The default minimum TLS version will be `12`.

**Resources supporting Availability Zones (containing a `zones` field):**

Zones will be made behaviourally consistent across the Provider, that means:

* Where a resource has to be provisioned within a single Zone, the field will be renamed `zone` (to indicate that only a single Zone can be specified).
* Where a resource can be provisioned across multiple Zones, the field will be named `zones`.
* Zones are no longer Computed - this means that if you wish Azure to assign an Availability Zone for this resource automatically, you must use `ignoreChanges` on the `zone`/`zones` field.

When the resource can be provisioned across multiple Zones, the following behaviours apply:

* To provision the resource without any Zones (zoneless) - omit the `zones` field.
* To provision the resource in a single Zone, specify one zone for the `zones` field (e.g. `zones = ["1"]`)
* To provision the resource across multiple Zones (Zone Redundant), specify all of Availability Zones for the `zones` field (e.g. `zones = ["1", "2", "3"]`)

**Resources with a (Managed) `identity` block:** The presence of an `identity` block means a Managed Identity should be assigned to this Resource - and the omission of an `identity` block (or a null value) means that no Managed Identity should be assigned to this Resource.

**Application Gateway:** The behavior of the nested items will be changed to Sets instead of Lists where required, meaning that the order of these items no longer matters. Note that if you're referencing these nested items within your Terraform Configuration, then this may require some code changes.

**API Management:** Terraform will now remove the Default API and Products for API Management when creating a new API Management instance, which is consistent with the behavior for other Terraform Providers.

**Firewall:** The behavior of the nested items will be changed to List instead of Sets where required, meaning that the order of these items now matters. Note that if you're referencing these nested items within your Terraform Configuration, then this may require some code changes.

**Log Analytics:** The `tags` field has been removed from various resources.

**Resource Groups:** Terraform will now check for Resources nested within a Resource Group prior to deletion of the resource group. If any items are found, an error will be raised. This behavior is configurable in the `features` block, but was previously disabled by default. In 3.0, this behavior will be enabled by default.

**Recovery Services:** The `tags` field has been removed from various resources.

**Storage:** The field `allowBlobPublicAccess` will be renamed to `allowNestedItemsToBePublic` to resolve confusion about what this field does. This field specifies whether items within the Storage Account (such as Containers and Blobs) can opt-in to being made public (for example at the Container or Blob level) - and not that all resources within this Storage Account are public by default.

**Other Individual Resources:**

* `azurermDatabaseMigrationService` - The provider will now delete this resource even if it still contains running tasks.
* `azurermIothub` - When creating a new `azurermIothub` resource, a Fallback Route will be enabled by default.
* `azurermMssqlDatabase` - The new field `transparentDataEncryptionEnabled` will be set to `true` and can not be disabled on servers with SKUs other than ones starting with `dw`.
* `azurermStorageShare` - The `quota` property is now required instead of defaulting to `5120` GB.

## Removal of Deprecated Fields, Data Sources and Resources

Since version 3.0 is a major version - we intend to take this opportunity to remove deprecated Fields, Resources, and Data Sources.
