# Data Source: azurermLbOutboundRule

Use this data source to access information about an existing Load Balancer Outbound Rule.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const dataAzurermLbOutboundRuleExample =
  new azurerm.dataAzurermLbOutboundRule.DataAzurermLbOutboundRule(
    this,
    "example",
    {
      loadbalancer_id: "existing_load_balancer_id",
      name: "existing_lb_outbound_rule",
    }
  );
new cdktf.TerraformOutput(this, "id", {
  value: dataAzurermLbOutboundRuleExample.id,
});

```

## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `name` - (Required) The name of this Load Balancer Outbound Rule.

*   `id` - The ID of the Load Balancer Outbound Rule.

*   `allocatedOutboundPorts` - The number of outbound ports used for NAT.

*   `backendAddressPoolId` - The ID of the Backend Address Pool. Outbound traffic is randomly load balanced across IPs in the backend IPs.

*   `frontendIpConfiguration` - A `frontendIpConfiguration` block as defined below.

*   `idleTimeoutInMinutes` - The timeout for the TCP idle connection.

*   `protocol` - The transport protocol for the external endpoint.

*   `tcpResetEnabled` - Is the bidirectional TCP Reset on TCP flow idle timeout or unexpected connection termination enabled? This value is useful when the protocol is set to TCP.
