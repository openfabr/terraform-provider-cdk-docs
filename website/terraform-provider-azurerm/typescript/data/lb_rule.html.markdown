# Data Source: azurermLbRule

Use this data source to access information about an existing Load Balancer Rule.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const dataAzurermLbExample = new azurerm.dataAzurermLb.DataAzurermLb(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    name: "example-lb",
    resource_group_name: "example-resources",
  }
);
const dataAzurermLbRuleExample =
  new azurerm.dataAzurermLbRule.DataAzurermLbRule(this, "example_1", {
    loadbalancer_id: dataAzurermLbExample.id,
    name: "first",
    resource_group_name: "example-resources",
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
dataAzurermLbRuleExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
new cdktf.TerraformOutput(this, "lb_rule_id", {
  value: dataAzurermLbRuleExample.id,
});

```
