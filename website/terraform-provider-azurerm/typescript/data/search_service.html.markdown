/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.

import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    location: "West Europe",
    name: "example-resources",
  }
);
const dataAzurermSearchServiceExample =
  new azurerm.dataAzurermSearchService.DataAzurermSearchService(
    this,
    "example_1",
    {
      name: "example-search-service",
      resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
    }
