# Data Source: azurermDnsCaaRecord

Use this data source to access information about an existing DNS CAA Record within Azure DNS.

\~> **Note:** [The Azure DNS API has a throttle limit of 500 read (GET) operations per 5 minutes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/request-limits-and-throttling#network-throttling) - whilst the default read timeouts will work for most cases - in larger configurations you may need to set a larger [read timeout](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) then the default 5min. Although, we'd generally recommend that you split the resources out into smaller Terraform configurations to avoid the problem entirely.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
new cdktf.TerraformOutput(this, "dns_caa_record_id", {
  value: "${data.azurerm_dns_caa_record.example.id}",
});
new azurerm.dnsCaaRecord.DnsCaaRecord(this, "example", {
  name: "test",
  resource_group_name: "test-rg",
  zone_name: "test-zone",
});

```

## Argument Reference

*   `name` - The name of the DNS CAA Record.

*   `resourceGroupName` - Specifies the resource group where the DNS Zone (parent resource) exists.

*   `zoneName` - Specifies the DNS Zone where the resource exists.

## Attributes Reference

*   `id` - The DNS CAA Record ID.

*   `fqdn` - The FQDN of the DNS CAA Record.

*   `ttl` - The Time To Live (TTL) of the DNS record in seconds.

*   `record` - A list of values that make up the CAA record. Each `record` block supports fields documented below.

*   `tags` - A mapping of tags assigned to the resource.

***

The `record` block supports:

*   `flags` - Extensible CAA flags, currently only 1 is implemented to set the issuer critical flag.

*   `tag` - A property tag, options are `issue`, `issuewild` and `iodef`.

*   `value` - A property value such as a registrar domain.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the DNS CAA Record.
