# Data Source: azurermMachineLearningWorkspace

Use this data source to access information about an existing Machine Learning Workspace.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
new azurerm.provider.AzurermProvider(this, "azurerm", {
  features: [{}],
});
new cdktf.TerraformOutput(this, "id", {
  value: "${azurerm_machine_learning_workspace.existing.id}",
});
new azurerm.dataAzurermMachineLearningWorkspace.DataAzurermMachineLearningWorkspace(
  this,
  "existing",
  {
    name: "example-workspace",
    resource_group_name: "example-resources",
  }
);

```
