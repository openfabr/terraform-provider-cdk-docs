# azurermCustomProvider

Manages an Azure Custom Provider.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    location: "West Europe",
    name: "example-resources",
  }
);
const azurermCustomProviderExample = new azurerm.customProvider.CustomProvider(
  this,
  "example_1",
  {
    location: azurermResourceGroupExample.location,
    name: "example_provider",
    resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
    resource_type: [
      {
        endpoint: "https://testendpoint.com/",
        name: "dEf1",
      },
    ],
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermCustomProviderExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```
