# azurermLighthouseAssignment

Manages a [Lighthouse](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/lighthouse) Assignment to a subscription, or to a resource group.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const dataAzurermSubscriptionPrimary =
  new azurerm.dataAzurermSubscription.DataAzurermSubscription(
    this,
    "primary",
    {}
  );
new azurerm.lighthouseAssignment.LighthouseAssignment(this, "example", {
  lighthouse_definition_id:
    "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/providers/Microsoft.ManagedServices/registrationDefinitions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  scope: dataAzurermSubscriptionPrimary.id,
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `name` - (Optional) A unique UUID/GUID which identifies this lighthouse assignment- one will be generated if not specified. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `scope` - (Required) The scope at which the Lighthouse Assignment applies too, such as `/subscriptions/0B1F64711Bf04DdaAec3111122223333` or `/subscriptions/0B1F64711Bf04DdaAec3111122223333/resourceGroups/myGroup`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `lighthouseDefinitionId` - (Required) A Fully qualified path of the lighthouse definition, such as `/subscriptions/0Afefe50734E46108C82A144Aff49Dea/providers/microsoftManagedServices/registrationDefinitions/26C128C2Fefa43409Bb18E081C90Ada2`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - the fully qualified ID of the Lighthouse Assignment.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Lighthouse Assignment.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Lighthouse Assignment.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Lighthouse Assignment.
