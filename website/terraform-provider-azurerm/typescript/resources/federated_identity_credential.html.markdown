# azurermFederatedIdentityCredential

Manages a Federated Identity Credential.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    location: "West Europe",
    name: "example",
  }
);
const azurermUserAssignedIdentityExample =
  new azurerm.userAssignedIdentity.UserAssignedIdentity(this, "example_1", {
    location: azurermResourceGroupExample.location,
    name: "example",
    resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermUserAssignedIdentityExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const azurermFederatedIdentityCredentialExample =
  new azurerm.federatedIdentityCredential.FederatedIdentityCredential(
    this,
    "example_2",
    {
      audience: ["foo"],
      issuer: "https://foo",
      name: "example",
      parent_id: azurermUserAssignedIdentityExample.id,
      resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
      subject: "foo",
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermFederatedIdentityCredentialExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```
