# azurermSiteRecoveryHypervReplicationPolicy

Manages a Azure Site Recovery replication policy for HyperV within a Recovery Vault. Replication policies define the frequency at which recovery points are created and how long they are stored.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    location: "East US",
    name: "example-rg",
  }
);
const azurermRecoveryServicesVaultVault =
  new azurerm.recoveryServicesVault.RecoveryServicesVault(this, "vault", {
    location: azurermResourceGroupExample.location,
    name: "example-recovery-vault",
    resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
    sku: "Standard",
  });
new azurerm.siteRecoveryHypervReplicationPolicy.SiteRecoveryHypervReplicationPolicy(
  this,
  "policy",
  {
    application_consistent_snapshot_frequency_in_hours: 1,
    name: "policy",
    recovery_point_retention_in_hours: 2,
    recovery_vault_name: azurermRecoveryServicesVaultVault.name,
    replication_interval_in_seconds: 300,
    resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
  }
);

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `name` - (Required) The name of the replication policy. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `resourceGroupName` - (Required) Name of the resource group where the vault that should be updated is located. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `recoveryVaultName` - (Required) The name of the vault that should be updated. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `recoveryPointRetentionInHours` - (Required) The duration in hours for which the recovery points need to be stored.

*   `applicationConsistentSnapshotFrequencyInHours` - (Required) Specifies the frequency at which to create application consistent recovery points.

*   `replicationIntervalInSeconds` - (Required) Specifies how frequently data should be synchronized between source and target locations. Possible values are `30` and `300`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Site Recovery Replication Policy.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Site Recovery Replication Policy.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Site Recovery Replication Policy.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Site Recovery Replication Policy.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Site Recovery Replication Policy.

## Import

Site Recovery Replication Policies can be imported using the `resourceId`, e.g.

```console
terraform import azurerm_site_recovery_hyperv_replication_policy.mypolicy /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/resource-group-name/providers/Microsoft.RecoveryServices/vaults/recovery-vault-name/replicationPolicies/policy-name
```
