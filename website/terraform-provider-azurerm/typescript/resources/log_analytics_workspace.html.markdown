# azurermLogAnalyticsWorkspace

Manages a Log Analytics (formally Operational Insights) Workspace.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    location: "West Europe",
    name: "example-resources",
  }
);
const azurermLogAnalyticsWorkspaceExample =
  new azurerm.logAnalyticsWorkspace.LogAnalyticsWorkspace(this, "example_1", {
    location: azurermResourceGroupExample.location,
    name: "acctest-01",
    resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
    retention_in_days: 30,
    sku: "PerGB2018",
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermLogAnalyticsWorkspaceExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Log Analytics Workspace. Workspace name should include 4-63 letters, digits or '-'. The '-' shouldn't be the first or the last symbol. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `resourceGroupName` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which the Log Analytics workspace is created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `allowResourceOnlyPermissions` - (Optional) Specifies if the log Analytics Workspace allow users accessing to data associated with resources they have permission to view, without permission to workspace. Defaults to `true`.

*   `localAuthenticationDisabled` - (Optional) Specifies if the log Analytics workspace should enforce authentication using Azure AD. Defaults to `false`.

*   `sku` - (Optional) Specifies the SKU of the Log Analytics Workspace. Possible values are `free`, `perNode`, `premium`, `standard`, `standalone`, `unlimited`, `capacityReservation`, and `perGb2018` (new SKU as of `20180403`). Defaults to `perGb2018`.

\~> **NOTE:** A new pricing model took effect on `20180403`, which requires the SKU `perGb2018`. If you're provisioned resources before this date you have the option of remaining with the previous Pricing SKU and using the other SKUs defined above. More information about [the Pricing SKUs is available at the following URI](https://aka.ms/PricingTierWarning).

\~> **NOTE:** The `free` SKU has a default `dailyQuotaGb` value of `05` (GB).

*   `retentionInDays` - (Optional) The workspace data retention in days. Possible values are either 7 (Free Tier only) or range between 30 and 730.

*   `dailyQuotaGb` - (Optional) The workspace daily quota for ingestion in GB. Defaults to -1 (unlimited) if omitted.

\~> **NOTE:** When `sku` is set to `free` this field should not be set and has a default value of `05`.

*   `cmkForQueryForced` - (Optional) Is Customer Managed Storage mandatory for query management?

*   `internetIngestionEnabled` - (Optional) Should the Log Analytics Workspace support ingestion over the Public Internet? Defaults to `true`.

*   `internetQueryEnabled` - (Optional) Should the Log Analytics Workspace support querying over the Public Internet? Defaults to `true`.

*   `reservationCapacityInGbPerDay` - (Optional) The capacity reservation level in GB for this workspace. Must be in increments of 100 between 100 and 5000.

\~> **NOTE:** `reservationCapacityInGbPerDay` can only be used when the `sku` is set to `capacityReservation`.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

\~> **NOTE:** If a `azurermLogAnalyticsWorkspace` is connected to a `azurermLogAnalyticsCluster` via a `azurermLogAnalyticsLinkedService` you will not be able to modify the workspaces `sku` field until the link between the workspace and the cluster has been broken by deleting the `azurermLogAnalyticsLinkedService` resource. All other fields are modifiable while the workspace is linked to a cluster.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

*   `id` - The Log Analytics Workspace ID.

*   `primarySharedKey` - The Primary shared key for the Log Analytics Workspace.

*   `secondarySharedKey` - The Secondary shared key for the Log Analytics Workspace.

*   `workspaceId` - The Workspace (or Customer) ID for the Log Analytics Workspace.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Log Analytics Workspace.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Log Analytics Workspace.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Log Analytics Workspace.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Log Analytics Workspace.

## Import

Log Analytics Workspaces can be imported using the `resourceId`, e.g.

```console
terraform import azurerm_log_analytics_workspace.workspace1 /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/workspace1
```
