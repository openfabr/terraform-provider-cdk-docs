## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    location: "West Europe",
    name: "tf-test",
  }
);
const azurermApplicationSecurityGroupExample =
  new azurerm.applicationSecurityGroup.ApplicationSecurityGroup(
    this,
    "example_1",
    {
      location: azurermResourceGroupExample.location,
      name: "tf-appsecuritygroup",
      resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
      tags: {
        Hello: "World",
      },
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermApplicationSecurityGroupExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
