# azurermDataProtectionBackupPolicyDisk

Manages a Backup Policy Disk.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    location: "West Europe",
    name: "example-resources",
  }
);
const azurermDataProtectionBackupVaultExample =
  new azurerm.dataProtectionBackupVault.DataProtectionBackupVault(
    this,
    "example_1",
    {
      datastore_type: "VaultStore",
      location: azurermResourceGroupExample.location,
      name: "example-backup-vault",
      redundancy: "LocallyRedundant",
      resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermDataProtectionBackupVaultExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const azurermDataProtectionBackupPolicyDiskExample =
  new azurerm.dataProtectionBackupPolicyDisk.DataProtectionBackupPolicyDisk(
    this,
    "example_2",
    {
      backup_repeating_time_intervals: ["R/2021-05-19T06:33:16+00:00/PT4H"],
      default_retention_duration: "P7D",
      name: "example-backup-policy",
      retention_rule: [
        {
          criteria: [
            {
              absolute_criteria: "FirstOfDay",
            },
          ],
          duration: "P7D",
          name: "Daily",
          priority: 25,
        },
        {
          criteria: [
            {
              absolute_criteria: "FirstOfWeek",
            },
          ],
          duration: "P7D",
          name: "Weekly",
          priority: 20,
        },
      ],
      vault_id: azurermDataProtectionBackupVaultExample.id,
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermDataProtectionBackupPolicyDiskExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `name` - (Required) The name which should be used for this Backup Policy Disk. Changing this forces a new Backup Policy Disk to be created.

*   `vaultId` - (Required) The ID of the Backup Vault within which the Backup Policy Disk should exist. Changing this forces a new Backup Policy Disk to be created.

*   `backupRepeatingTimeIntervals` - (Required) Specifies a list of repeating time interval. It should follow `iso8601` repeating time interval . Changing this forces a new Backup Policy Disk to be created.

*   `defaultRetentionDuration` - (Required) The duration of default retention rule. It should follow `iso8601` duration format. Changing this forces a new Backup Policy Disk to be created.

***

* `retentionRule` - (Optional) One or more `retentionRule` blocks as defined below. Changing this forces a new Backup Policy Disk to be created.

***

A `retentionRule` block supports the following:

*   `name` - (Required) The name which should be used for this retention rule. Changing this forces a new Backup Policy Disk to be created.

*   `duration` - (Required) Duration of deletion after given timespan. It should follow `iso8601` duration format. Changing this forces a new Backup Policy Disk to be created.

*   `criteria` - (Required) A `criteria` block as defined below. Changing this forces a new Backup Policy Disk to be created.

*   `priority` - (Required) Retention Tag priority. Changing this forces a new Backup Policy Disk to be created.

***

A `criteria` block supports the following:

* `absoluteCriteria` - (Optional) Possible values are `firstOfDay` and `firstOfWeek`. Changing this forces a new Backup Policy Disk to be created.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Backup Policy Disk.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Backup Policy Disk.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Backup Policy Disk.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Backup Policy Disk.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Backup Policy Disk.

## Import

Backup Policy Disks can be imported using the `resourceId`, e.g.

```console
terraform import azurerm_data_protection_backup_policy_disk.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.DataProtection/backupVaults/vault1/backupPolicies/backupPolicy1
```
