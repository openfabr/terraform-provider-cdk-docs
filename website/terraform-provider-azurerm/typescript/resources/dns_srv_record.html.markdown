# azurermDnsSrvRecord

Enables you to manage DNS SRV Records within Azure DNS.

\~> **Note:** [The Azure DNS API has a throttle limit of 500 read (GET) operations per 5 minutes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/request-limits-and-throttling#network-throttling) - whilst the default read timeouts will work for most cases - in larger configurations you may need to set a larger [read timeout](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) then the default 5min. Although, we'd generally recommend that you split the resources out into smaller Terraform configurations to avoid the problem entirely.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    location: "West Europe",
    name: "example-resources",
  }
);
const azurermDnsZoneExample = new azurerm.dnsZone.DnsZone(this, "example_1", {
  name: "mydomain.com",
  resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
});
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermDnsZoneExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const azurermDnsSrvRecordExample = new azurerm.dnsSrvRecord.DnsSrvRecord(
  this,
  "example_2",
  {
    name: "test",
    record: [
      {
        port: 8080,
        priority: 1,
        target: "target1.contoso.com",
        weight: 5,
      },
    ],
    resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
    tags: {
      Environment: "Production",
    },
    ttl: 300,
    zone_name: azurermDnsZoneExample.name,
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermDnsSrvRecordExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `name` - (Required) The name of the DNS SRV Record. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `resourceGroupName` - (Required) Specifies the resource group where the DNS Zone (parent resource) exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `zoneName` - (Required) Specifies the DNS Zone where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `ttl` - (Required) The Time To Live (TTL) of the DNS record in seconds.

*   `record` - (Required) A list of values that make up the SRV record. Each `record` block supports fields documented below.

*   `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

***

The `record` block supports:

*   `priority` - (Required) Priority of the SRV record.

*   `weight` - (Required) Weight of the SRV record.

*   `port` - (Required) Port the service is listening on.

*   `target` - (Required) FQDN of the service.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

*   `id` - The DNS SRV Record ID.

*   `fqdn` - The FQDN of the DNS SRV Record.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

*   `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the DNS SRV Record.

*   `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the DNS SRV Record.

*   `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the DNS SRV Record.

*   `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the DNS SRV Record.

## Import

SRV records can be imported using the `resourceId`, e.g.

```console
terraform import azurerm_dns_srv_record.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.Network/dnsZones/zone1/SRV/myrecord1
```
