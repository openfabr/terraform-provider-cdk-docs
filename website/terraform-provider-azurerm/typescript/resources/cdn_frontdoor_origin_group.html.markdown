# azurermCdnFrontdoorOriginGroup

Manages a Front Door (standard/premium) Origin Group.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    location: "West Europe",
    name: "example-cdn-frontdoor",
  }
);
const azurermCdnFrontdoorProfileExample =
  new azurerm.cdnFrontdoorProfile.CdnFrontdoorProfile(this, "example_1", {
    name: "example-profile",
    resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermCdnFrontdoorProfileExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const azurermCdnFrontdoorOriginGroupExample =
  new azurerm.cdnFrontdoorOriginGroup.CdnFrontdoorOriginGroup(
    this,
    "example_2",
    {
      cdn_frontdoor_profile_id: azurermCdnFrontdoorProfileExample.id,
      health_probe: [
        {
          interval_in_seconds: 240,
          path: "/healthProbe",
          protocol: "Https",
          request_type: "HEAD",
        },
      ],
      load_balancing: [
        {
          additional_latency_in_milliseconds: 0,
          sample_size: 16,
          successful_samples_required: 3,
        },
      ],
      name: "example-origin-group",
      restore_traffic_time_to_healed_or_new_endpoint_in_minutes: 10,
      session_affinity_enabled: true,
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermCdnFrontdoorOriginGroupExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `name` - (Required) The name which should be used for this Front Door Origin Group. Changing this forces a new Front Door Origin Group to be created.

*   `cdnFrontdoorProfileId` - (Required) The ID of the Front Door Profile within which this Front Door Origin Group should exist. Changing this forces a new Front Door Origin Group to be created.

*   `loadBalancing` - (Required) A `loadBalancing` block as defined below.

***

*   `healthProbe` - (Optional) A `healthProbe` block as defined below.

*   `restoreTrafficTimeToHealedOrNewEndpointInMinutes` - (Optional) Specifies the amount of time which should elapse before shifting traffic to another endpoint when a healthy endpoint becomes unhealthy or a new endpoint is added. Possible values are between `0` and `50` minutes (inclusive). Default is `10` minutes.

\-> **NOTE:** This property is currently not used, but will be in the near future.

* `sessionAffinityEnabled` - (Optional) Specifies whether session affinity should be enabled on this host. Defaults to `true`.

***

A `healthProbe` block supports the following:

*   `protocol` - (Required) Specifies the protocol to use for health probe. Possible values are `http` and `https`.

*   `intervalInSeconds` - (Required) Specifies the number of seconds between health probes. Possible values are between `5` and `31536000` seconds (inclusive).

*   `requestType` - (Optional) Specifies the type of health probe request that is made. Possible values are `get` and `head`. Defaults to `head`.

*   `path` - (Optional) Specifies the path relative to the origin that is used to determine the health of the origin. Defaults to `/`.

\-> **NOTE:** Health probes can only be disabled if there is a single enabled origin in a single enabled origin group. For more information about the `healthProbe` settings please see the [product documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/health-probes).

***

A `loadBalancing` block supports the following:

*   `additionalLatencyInMilliseconds` - (Optional) Specifies the additional latency in milliseconds for probes to fall into the lowest latency bucket. Possible values are between `0` and `1000` seconds (inclusive). Defaults to `50`.

*   `sampleSize` - (Optional) Specifies the number of samples to consider for load balancing decisions. Possible values are between `0` and `255` (inclusive). Defaults to `4`.

*   `successfulSamplesRequired` - (Optional) Specifies the number of samples within the sample period that must succeed. Possible values are between `0` and `255` (inclusive). Defaults to `3`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Front Door Origin Group.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Front Door Origin Group.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Front Door Origin Group.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Front Door Origin Group.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Front Door Origin Group.

## Import

Front Door Origin Groups can be imported using the `resourceId`, e.g.

```console
terraform import azurerm_cdn_frontdoor_origin_group.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/resourceGroup1/providers/Microsoft.Cdn/profiles/profile1/originGroups/originGroup1
```
