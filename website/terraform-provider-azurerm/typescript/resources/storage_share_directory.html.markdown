# azurermStorageShareDirectory

Manages a Directory within an Azure Storage File Share.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    location: "West Europe",
    name: "azuretest",
  }
);
const azurermStorageAccountExample = new azurerm.storageAccount.StorageAccount(
  this,
  "example_1",
  {
    account_replication_type: "LRS",
    account_tier: "Standard",
    location: azurermResourceGroupExample.location,
    name: "azureteststorage",
    resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermStorageAccountExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const azurermStorageShareExample = new azurerm.storageShare.StorageShare(
  this,
  "example_2",
  {
    name: "sharename",
    quota: 50,
    storage_account_name: azurermStorageAccountExample.name,
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermStorageShareExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const azurermStorageShareDirectoryExample =
  new azurerm.storageShareDirectory.StorageShareDirectory(this, "example_3", {
    name: "example",
    share_name: azurermStorageShareExample.name,
    storage_account_name: azurermStorageAccountExample.name,
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermStorageShareDirectoryExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

## Argument Reference

*   `name` - (Required) The name (or path) of the Directory that should be created within this File Share. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `shareName` - (Required) The name of the File Share where this Directory should be created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `storageAccountName` - (Required) The name of the Storage Account within which the File Share is located. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `metadata` - (Optional) A mapping of metadata to assign to this Directory.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported in addition to the arguments listed above:

* `id` - The ID of the Directory within the File Share.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Storage Share Directory.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Storage Share Directory.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Storage Share Directory.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Storage Share Directory.

## Import

Directories within an Azure Storage File Share can be imported using the `resourceId`, e.g.

```console
terraform import azurerm_storage_share_directory.example https://tomdevsa20.file.core.windows.net/share1/directory1
```
