# azurermStorageManagementPolicy

Manages an Azure Storage Account Management Policy.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    location: "West Europe",
    name: "resourceGroupName",
  }
);
const azurermStorageAccountExample = new azurerm.storageAccount.StorageAccount(
  this,
  "example_1",
  {
    account_kind: "BlobStorage",
    account_replication_type: "LRS",
    account_tier: "Standard",
    location: azurermResourceGroupExample.location,
    name: "storageaccountname",
    resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermStorageAccountExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const azurermStorageManagementPolicyExample =
  new azurerm.storageManagementPolicy.StorageManagementPolicy(
    this,

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `storageAccountId` - (Required) Specifies the id of the storage account to apply the management policy to. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `rule` - (Optional) A `rule` block as documented below.

***

The `rule` block supports the following:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the rule. Rule name is case-sensitive. It must be unique within a policy.
* `enabled` - (Required) Boolean to specify whether the rule is enabled.
* `filters` - (Required) A `filters` block as documented below.
* `actions` - (Required) An `actions` block as documented below.

***

The `filters` block supports the following:

* `blobTypes` - (Required) An array of predefined values. Valid options are `blockBlob` and `appendBlob`.
* `prefixMatch` - (Optional) An array of strings for prefixes to be matched.
* `matchBlobIndexTag` - (Optional) A `matchBlobIndexTag` block as defined below. The block defines the blob index tag based filtering for blob objects.

\~> **NOTE:** The `matchBlobIndexTag` property requires enabling the `blobIndex` feature with [PSH or CLI commands](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/manage-and-find-data-with-blob-index-for-azure-storage-now-in-preview/).

***

The `actions` block supports the following:

* `baseBlob` - (Optional) A `baseBlob` block as documented below.
* `snapshot` - (Optional) A `snapshot` block as documented below.
* `version` - (Optional) A `version` block as documented below.

***

The `baseBlob` block supports the following:

* `tierToCoolAfterDaysSinceModificationGreaterThan` - (Optional) The age in days after last modification to tier blobs to cool storage. Supports blob currently at Hot tier. Must be between 0 and 99999. Defaults to `1`.
* `tierToCoolAfterDaysSinceLastAccessTimeGreaterThan` - (Optional) The age in days after last access time to tier blobs to cool storage. Supports blob currently at Hot tier. Must be between `0` and `99999`. Defaults to `1`.
* `tierToCoolAfterDaysSinceCreationGreaterThan` - (Optional) The age in days after creation to cool storage. Supports blob currently at Hot tier. Must be between `0` and `99999`. Defaults to `1`.

\~> **Note:** The `tierToCoolAfterDaysSinceModificationGreaterThan`, `tierToCoolAfterDaysSinceLastAccessTimeGreaterThan` and `tierToCoolAfterDaysSinceCreationGreaterThan` can not be set at the same time.

* `autoTierToHotFromCoolEnabled` - (Optional) Whether a blob should automatically be tiered from cool back to hot if it's accessed again after being tiered to cool. Defaults to `false`.

\~> **Note:** The `autoTierToHotFromCoolEnabled` must be used together with `tierToCoolAfterDaysSinceLastAccessTimeGreaterThan`.

* `tierToArchiveAfterDaysSinceModificationGreaterThan` - (Optional) The age in days after last modification to tier blobs to archive storage. Supports blob currently at Hot or Cool tier. Must be between 0 and 99999. Defaults to `1`.
* `tierToArchiveAfterDaysSinceLastAccessTimeGreaterThan` - (Optional) The age in days after last access time to tier blobs to archive storage. Supports blob currently at Hot or Cool tier. Must be between `0` and`99999`. Defaults to `1`.
* `tierToArchiveAfterDaysSinceCreationGreaterThan` - (Optional) The age in days after creation to archive storage. Supports blob currently at Hot or Cool tier. Must be between `0` and`99999`. Defaults to `1`.

\~> **Note:** The `tierToArchiveAfterDaysSinceModificationGreaterThan`, `tierToArchiveAfterDaysSinceLastAccessTimeGreaterThan` and `tierToArchiveAfterDaysSinceCreationGreaterThan` can not be set at the same time.

*   `tierToArchiveAfterDaysSinceLastTierChangeGreaterThan` - (Optional) The age in days after last tier change to the blobs to skip to be archved. Must be between 0 and 99999. Defaults to `1`.

*   `deleteAfterDaysSinceModificationGreaterThan` - (Optional) The age in days after last modification to delete the blob. Must be between 0 and 99999. Defaults to `1`.

*   `deleteAfterDaysSinceLastAccessTimeGreaterThan` - (Optional) The age in days after last access time to delete the blob. Must be between `0` and `99999`. Defaults to `1`.

*   `deleteAfterDaysSinceCreationGreaterThan` - (Optional) The age in days after creation to delete the blob. Must be between `0` and `99999`. Defaults to `1`.

\~> **Note:** The `deleteAfterDaysSinceModificationGreaterThan`, `deleteAfterDaysSinceLastAccessTimeGreaterThan` and `deleteAfterDaysSinceCreationGreaterThan` can not be set at the same time.

\~> **Note:** The [`lastAccessTimeEnabled`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/storage_account#last_access_time_enabled) must be set to `true` in the `azurermStorageAccount` in order to use `tierToCoolAfterDaysSinceLastAccessTimeGreaterThan`, `tierToArchiveAfterDaysSinceLastAccessTimeGreaterThan` and `deleteAfterDaysSinceLastAccessTimeGreaterThan`.

* `deleteAfterDaysSinceCreation` - (Optional) The age in days after creation to delete the blob version. Must be between 0 and 99999. Defaults to `1`.

***

The `matchBlobIndexTag` block supports the following:

* `name` - (Required) The filter tag name used for tag based filtering for blob objects.
* `operation` - (Optional) The comparison operator which is used for object comparison and filtering. Possible value is `==`. Defaults to `==`.

* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Storage Account Management Policy.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Storage Account Management Policy.

## Import

Storage Account Management Policies can be imported using the `resourceId`, e.g.

```console
terraform import azurerm_storage_management_policy.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/myaccountname/managementPolicies/default
```
