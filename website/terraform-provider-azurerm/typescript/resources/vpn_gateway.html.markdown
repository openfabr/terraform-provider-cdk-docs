# azurermVpnGateway

Manages a VPN Gateway within a Virtual Hub, which enables Site-to-Site communication.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    location: "West Europe",
    name: "example-resources",
  }
);
const azurermVirtualNetworkExample = new azurerm.virtualNetwork.VirtualNetwork(
  this,
  "example_1",
  {
    address_space: ["10.0.0.0/16"],
    location: azurermResourceGroupExample.location,
    name: "example-network",
    resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermVirtualNetworkExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const azurermVirtualWanExample = new azurerm.virtualWan.VirtualWan(
  this,
  "example_2",
  {
    location: azurermResourceGroupExample.location,
    name: "example-vwan",
    resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermVirtualWanExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const azurermVirtualHubExample = new azurerm.virtualHub.VirtualHub(
  this,
  "example_3",
  {
    address_prefix: "10.0.1.0/24",
    location: azurermResourceGroupExample.location,
    name: "example-hub",
    resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
    virtual_wan_id: azurermVirtualWanExample.id,
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermVirtualHubExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const azurermVpnGatewayExample = new azurerm.vpnGateway.VpnGateway(
  this,
  "example_4",
  {
    location: azurermResourceGroupExample.location,
    name: "example-vpng",
    resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
    virtual_hub_id: azurermVirtualHubExample.id,
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermVpnGatewayExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `name` - (Required) The Name which should be used for this VPN Gateway. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `resourceGroupName` - (Required) The Name of the Resource Group in which this VPN Gateway should be created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `location` - (Required) The Azure location where this VPN Gateway should be created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `virtualHubId` - (Required) The ID of the Virtual Hub within which this VPN Gateway should be created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

***

*   `bgpRouteTranslationForNatEnabled` - (Optional) Is BGP route translation for NAT on this VPN Gateway enabled? Defaults to `false`.

*   `bgpSettings` - (Optional) A `bgpSettings` block as defined below.

*   `routingPreference` - (Optional) Azure routing preference lets you to choose how your traffic routes between Azure and the internet. You can choose to route traffic either via the Microsoft network (default value, `microsoftNetwork`), or via the ISP network (public internet, set to `internet`). More context of the configuration can be found in the [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-wan/virtual-wan-site-to-site-portal#gateway) to create a VPN Gateway. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `scaleUnit` - (Optional) The Scale Unit for this VPN Gateway. Defaults to `1`.

*   `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the VPN Gateway.

***

A `bgpSettings` block supports the following:

*   `asn` - (Required) The ASN of the BGP Speaker. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `peerWeight` - (Required) The weight added to Routes learned from this BGP Speaker. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `instance0BgpPeeringAddress` - (Optional) An `instanceBgpPeeringAddress` block as defined below.

*   `instance1BgpPeeringAddress` - (Optional) An `instanceBgpPeeringAddress` block as defined below.

***

A `instanceBgpPeeringAddress` block supports the following:

* `customIps` - (Required) A list of custom BGP peering addresses to assign to this instance.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

*   `id` - The ID of the VPN Gateway.

*   `bgpSettings` - A `bgpSettings` block as defined below.

***

A `bgpSettings` block exports the following:

*   `bgpPeeringAddress` - The Address which should be used for the BGP Peering.

*   `instance0BgpPeeringAddress` - an `instanceBgpPeeringAddress` block as defined below.

*   `instance1BgpPeeringAddress` - an `instanceBgpPeeringAddress` block as defined below.

***

A `instanceBgpPeeringAddress` block exports the following:

*   `ipConfigurationId` - The pre-defined id of VPN Gateway IP Configuration.

*   `defaultIps` - The list of default BGP peering addresses which belong to the pre-defined VPN Gateway IP configuration.

*   `tunnelIps` - The list of tunnel public IP addresses which belong to the pre-defined VPN Gateway IP configuration.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 90 minutes) Used when creating the VPN Gateway.
* `update` - (Defaults to 90 minutes) Used when updating the VPN Gateway.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the VPN Gateway.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 90 minutes) Used when deleting the VPN Gateway.

## Import

VPN Gateways can be imported using the `resourceId`, e.g.

```console
terraform import azurerm_vpn_gateway.gateway1 /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.Network/vpnGateways/gateway1
```
