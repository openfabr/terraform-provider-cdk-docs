# azurermManagementLock

Manages a Management Lock which is scoped to a Subscription, Resource Group or Resource.

## Example Usage (Subscription Level Lock)

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const dataAzurermSubscriptionCurrent =
  new azurerm.dataAzurermSubscription.DataAzurermSubscription(
    this,
    "current",
    {}
  );
new azurerm.managementLock.ManagementLock(this, "subscription-level", {
  lock_level: "CanNotDelete",
  name: "subscription-level",
  notes: "Items can't be deleted in this subscription!",
  scope: dataAzurermSubscriptionCurrent.id,
});

```

## Example Usage (Resource Group Level Lock)

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    location: "West Europe",
    name: "locked-resource-group",
  }
);
new azurerm.managementLock.ManagementLock(this, "resource-group-level", {
  lock_level: "ReadOnly",
  name: "resource-group-level",
  notes: "This Resource Group is Read-Only",
  scope: azurermResourceGroupExample.id,
});

```

## Example Usage (Resource Level Lock)

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    location: "West Europe",
    name: "locked-resource-group",
  }
);
const azurermPublicIpExample = new azurerm.publicIp.PublicIp(
  this,
  "example_1",
  {
    allocation_method: "Static",
    idle_timeout_in_minutes: 30,
    location: azurermResourceGroupExample.location,
    name: "locked-publicip",
    resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermPublicIpExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
new azurerm.managementLock.ManagementLock(this, "public-ip", {
  lock_level: "CanNotDelete",
  name: "resource-ip",
  notes: "Locked because it's needed by a third-party",
  scope: azurermPublicIpExample.id,
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Management Lock. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `scope` - (Required) Specifies the scope at which the Management Lock should be created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `lockLevel` - (Required) Specifies the Level to be used for this Lock. Possible values are `canNotDelete` and `readOnly`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

\~> **Note:** `canNotDelete` means authorized users are able to read and modify the resources, but not delete. `readOnly` means authorized users can only read from a resource, but they can't modify or delete it.

* `notes` - (Optional) Specifies some notes about the lock. Maximum of 512 characters. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Management Lock

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Management Lock.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Management Lock.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Management Lock.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Management Lock.
