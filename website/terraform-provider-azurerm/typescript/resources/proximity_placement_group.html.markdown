# azurermProximityPlacementGroup

Manages a proximity placement group for virtual machines, virtual machine scale sets and availability sets.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    location: "West Europe",
    name: "example-resources",
  }
);
const azurermProximityPlacementGroupExample =
  new azurerm.proximityPlacementGroup.ProximityPlacementGroup(
    this,
    "example_1",
    {
      location: azurermResourceGroupExample.location,
      name: "exampleProximityPlacementGroup",
      resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
      tags: {
        environment: "Production",
      },
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermProximityPlacementGroupExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the proximity placement group. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `resourceGroupName` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to create the availability set. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `allowedVmSizes` - (Optional) Specifies the supported sizes of Virtual Machines that can be created in the Proximity Placement Group.

\~> **NOTE:** Removing `allowedVmSizes` after it is set forces a new resource to be created.

* `zone` - (Optional) Specifies the supported zone of the Proximity Placement Group. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

\~> **NOTE:** `allowedVmSizes` must be set when `zone` is specified.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.
