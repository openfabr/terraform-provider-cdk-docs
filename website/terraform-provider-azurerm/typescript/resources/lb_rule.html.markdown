# azurermLbRule

Manages a Load Balancer Rule.

\~> **NOTE** When using this resource, the Load Balancer needs to have a FrontEnd IP Configuration Attached

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    location: "West Europe",
    name: "LoadBalancerRG",
  }
);
const azurermPublicIpExample = new azurerm.publicIp.PublicIp(
  this,
  "example_1",
  {
    allocation_method: "Static",
    location: "West US",
    name: "PublicIPForLB",
    resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermPublicIpExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const azurermLbExample = new azurerm.lb.Lb(this, "example_2", {
  frontend_ip_configuration: [
    {
      name: "PublicIPAddress",
      public_ip_address_id: azurermPublicIpExample.id,
    },
  ],
  location: "West US",
  name: "TestLoadBalancer",
  resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
});
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermLbExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const azurermLbRuleExample = new azurerm.lbRule.LbRule(this, "example_3", {
  backend_port: 3389,
  frontend_ip_configuration_name: "PublicIPAddress",
  frontend_port: 3389,
  loadbalancer_id: azurermLbExample.id,
  name: "LBRule",
  protocol: "Tcp",
});
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermLbRuleExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the LB Rule. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
* `loadbalancerId` - (Required) The ID of the Load Balancer in which to create the Rule. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
* `frontendIpConfigurationName` - (Required) The name of the frontend IP configuration to which the rule is associated.
* `protocol` - (Required) The transport protocol for the external endpoint. Possible values are `tcp`, `udp` or `all`.
* `frontendPort` - (Required) The port for the external endpoint. Port numbers for each Rule must be unique within the Load Balancer. Possible values range between 0 and 65534, inclusive.
* `backendPort` - (Required) The port used for internal connections on the endpoint. Possible values range between 0 and 65535, inclusive.
* `backendAddressPoolIds` - (Optional) A list of reference to a Backend Address Pool over which this Load Balancing Rule operates.

\~> **NOTE:** In most cases users can only set one Backend Address Pool ID in the `backendAddressPoolIds`. Especially, when the sku of the LB is `gateway`, users can set up to two IDs in the `backendAddressPoolIds`.

* `probeId` - (Optional) A reference to a Probe used by this Load Balancing Rule.
* `enableFloatingIp` - (Optional) Are the Floating IPs enabled for this Load Balncer Rule? A "floating” IP is reassigned to a secondary server in case the primary server fails. Required to configure a SQL AlwaysOn Availability Group. Defaults to `false`.
* `idleTimeoutInMinutes` - (Optional) Specifies the idle timeout in minutes for TCP connections. Valid values are between `4` and `30` minutes. Defaults to `4` minutes.
* `loadDistribution` - (Optional) Specifies the load balancing distribution type to be used by the Load Balancer. Possible values are: `default` – The load balancer is configured to use a 5 tuple hash to map traffic to available servers. `sourceIp` – The load balancer is configured to use a 2 tuple hash to map traffic to available servers. `sourceIpProtocol` – The load balancer is configured to use a 3 tuple hash to map traffic to available servers. Also known as Session Persistence, where the options are called `none`, `clientIp` and `clientIpAndProtocol` respectively.
* `disableOutboundSnat` - (Optional) Is snat enabled for this Load Balancer Rule? Default `false`.
* `enableTcpReset` - (Optional) Is TCP Reset enabled for this Load Balancer Rule?

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Load Balancer Rule.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Load Balancer Rule.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Load Balancer Rule.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Load Balancer Rule.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Load Balancer Rule.

## Import

Load Balancer Rules can be imported using the `resourceId`, e.g.

```console
terraform import azurerm_lb_rule.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/lb1/loadBalancingRules/rule1
```
