# azurerm\_app\_service\_active\_slot

Promotes an App Service Slot to Production within an App Service.

!> **NOTE:** This resource has been deprecated in version 3.0 of the AzureRM provider and will be removed in version 4.0. Please use [`azurermWebAppActiveSlot`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/web_app_active_slot) resource instead.

\-> **Note:** When using Slots - the `appSettings`, `connectionString` and `siteConfig` blocks on the `azurermAppService` resource will be overwritten when promoting a Slot using the `azurermAppServiceActiveSlot` resource.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
import * as random from "./.gen/providers/random";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm, random.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermAppServiceExample = new azurerm.appService.AppService(
  this,
  "example",
  {}
);
const azurermAppServicePlanExample = new azurerm.appServicePlan.AppServicePlan(
  this,
  "example_1",
  {}
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermAppServicePlanExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const azurermAppServiceSlotExample = new azurerm.appServiceSlot.AppServiceSlot(
  this,
  "example_2",
  {}
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermAppServiceSlotExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example_3",
  {}
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermResourceGroupExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
new random.id.Id(this, "server", {});
const azurermAppServiceActiveSlotExample =
  new azurerm.appServiceActiveSlot.AppServiceActiveSlot(this, "example_5", {
    app_service_name: azurermAppServiceExample.name,
    app_service_slot_name: azurermAppServiceSlotExample.name,
    resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermAppServiceActiveSlotExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `resourceGroupName` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which the App Service exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `appServiceName` - (Required) The name of the App Service within which the Slot exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `appServiceSlotName` - (Required) The name of the App Service Slot which should be promoted to the Production Slot within the App Service.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the App Service Active Slot.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the App Service Active Slot.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the App Service Active Slot.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the App Service Active Slot.
