# azurerm\_ip\_group

Manages an IP group that contains a list of CIDRs and/or IP addresses.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    location: "West Europe",
    name: "example-rg",
  }
);
const azurermIpGroupExample = new azurerm.ipGroup.IpGroup(this, "example_1", {
  cidrs: ["192.168.0.1", "172.16.240.0/20", "10.48.0.0/12"],
  location: azurermResourceGroupExample.location,
  name: "example1-ipgroup",
  resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
  tags: {
    environment: "Production",
  },
});
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermIpGroupExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the IP group. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `resourceGroupName` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to create the IP group. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `cidrs` - (Optional) A list of CIDRs or IP addresses.

\~> **NOTE:** The AzureRM Terraform provider provides cidr support via the standalone resource [azurerm\_ip\_group\_cidr](ip_group_cidr.html) and in-line within this resource using the `cidrs` property. You cannot use both methods simultaneously. If cidrs are set via the resource `azurermIpGroupCidr` then `ignoreChanges` should be used in the ip group configuration.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

*   `id` - The ID of the IP group.

*   `firewallIds` - A `firewallIds` block as defined below.

*   `firewallPolicyIds` - A `firewallPolicyIds` block as defined below.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the IP Group.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the IP Group.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the IP Group.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the IP Group.

## Import

IP Groups can be imported using the `resourceId`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_ip_group.ipgroup1 /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.Network/ipGroups/myIpGroup
```
