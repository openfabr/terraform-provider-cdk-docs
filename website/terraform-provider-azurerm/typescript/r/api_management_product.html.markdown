## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    location: "West Europe",
    name: "example-resources",
  }
);
const azurermApiManagementExample = new azurerm.apiManagement.ApiManagement(
  this,
  "example_1",
  {
    location: azurermResourceGroupExample.location,
    name: "example-apim",
    publisher_email: "company@terraform.io",
    publisher_name: "My Company",
    resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
    sku_name: "Developer_1",
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermApiManagementExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const azurermApiManagementProductExample =
  new azurerm.apiManagementProduct.ApiManagementProduct(this, "example_2", {
    api_management_name: azurermApiManagementExample.name,
    approval_required: true,

azurermApiManagementProductExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
