# azurerm\_eventgrid\_topic

Manages an EventGrid Topic

\~> **Note:** at this time EventGrid Topic's are only available in a limited number of regions.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    location: "West Europe",
    name: "example-resources",
  }
);
const azurermEventgridTopicExample = new azurerm.eventgridTopic.EventgridTopic(
  this,
  "example_1",
  {
    location: azurermResourceGroupExample.location,
    name: "my-eventgrid-topic",
    resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
    tags: {
      environment: "Production",
    },
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermEventgridTopicExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```
