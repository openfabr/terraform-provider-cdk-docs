# azurerm\_lb\_backend\_address\_pool\_address

Manages a Backend Address within a Backend Address Pool.

\-> **Note:** Backend Addresses can only be added to a `standard` SKU Load Balancer.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const dataAzurermLbExample = new azurerm.dataAzurermLb.DataAzurermLb(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    name: "example-lb",
    resource_group_name: "example-resources",
  }
);
const dataAzurermLbBackendAddressPoolBackendPoolCr =
  new azurerm.dataAzurermLbBackendAddressPool.DataAzurermLbBackendAddressPool(
    this,
    "backend-pool-cr",
    {
      loadbalancer_id: dataAzurermLbExample.id,
      name: "globalLBBackendPool",
    }
  );
const dataAzurermLbBackendAddressPoolExample =
  new azurerm.dataAzurermLbBackendAddressPool.DataAzurermLbBackendAddressPool(
    this,
    "example_2",
    {
      loadbalancer_id: dataAzurermLbExample.id,
      name: "first",
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
dataAzurermLbBackendAddressPoolExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const dataAzurermVirtualNetworkExample =
  new azurerm.dataAzurermVirtualNetwork.DataAzurermVirtualNetwork(
    this,
    "example_3",
    {
      name: "example-network",
      resource_group_name: "example-resources",
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
dataAzurermVirtualNetworkExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const azurermLbBackendAddressPoolAddressExample =
  new azurerm.lbBackendAddressPoolAddress.LbBackendAddressPoolAddress(
    this,
    "example_4",
    {
      backend_address_pool_id: dataAzurermLbBackendAddressPoolExample.id,
      ip_address: "10.0.0.1",
      name: "example",
      virtual_network_id: dataAzurermVirtualNetworkExample.id,
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermLbBackendAddressPoolAddressExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
new azurerm.lbBackendAddressPoolAddress.LbBackendAddressPoolAddress(
  this,
  "example-1",
  {
    backend_address_ip_configuration_id:
      "${azurerm_lb.backend-lb-R1.frontend_ip_configuration[0].id}",
    backend_address_pool_id: dataAzurermLbBackendAddressPoolBackendPoolCr.id,
    name: "address1",
  }
);
new azurerm.lbBackendAddressPoolAddress.LbBackendAddressPoolAddress(
  this,
  "example-2",
  {
    backend_address_ip_configuration_id:
      "${azurerm_lb.backend-lb-R2.frontend_ip_configuration[0].id}",
    backend_address_pool_id: dataAzurermLbBackendAddressPoolBackendPoolCr.id,
    name: "address2",
  }
);

```

## Arguments Reference

\-> **Note:** Backend Addresses can only be added to a `standard` SKU Load Balancer. Cross region load balancer is for Load Balancer with `global` SKU.

The following arguments are supported:

*   `backendAddressPoolId` - (Required) The ID of the Backend Address Pool. Changing this forces a new Backend Address Pool Address to be created.

*   `ipAddress` - (Optional) The Static IP Address which should be allocated to this Backend Address Pool.

*   `name` - (Required) The name which should be used for this Backend Address Pool Address. Changing this forces a new Backend Address Pool Address to be created.

*   `virtualNetworkId` - (Optional) The ID of the Virtual Network within which the Backend Address Pool should exist.

*   `backendAddressIpConfigurationId` - (Optional) The ip config ID of the regional load balancer that's added to the global load balancer's backend address pool.

\-> **Note:** For cross-region load balancer, please append the name of the load balancers, virtual machines, and other resources in each region with a -R1 and -R2.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

*   `id` - The ID of the Backend Address Pool Address.

*   `inboundNatRulePortMapping` - A list of `inboundNatRulePortMapping` block as defined below.

***

A `inboundNatRulePortMapping` block exports the following:

*   `inboundNatRuleName` - The name of the Load Balancing Inbound NAT Rules associated with this Backend Address Pool Address.

*   `frontendPort` - The Frontend Port of the Load Balancing Inbound NAT Rules associated with this Backend Address Pool Address.

*   `backendPort` - The Backend Port of the Load Balancing Inbound NAT Rules associated with this Backend Address Pool Address.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Backend Address Pool Address.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Backend Address Pool Address.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Backend Address Pool Address.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Backend Address Pool Address.

## Import

Backend Address Pool Addresses can be imported using the `resourceId`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_lb_backend_address_pool_address.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/loadBalancer1/backendAddressPools/backendAddressPool1/addresses/address1
```
