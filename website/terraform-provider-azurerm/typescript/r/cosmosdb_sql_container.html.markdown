# azurerm\_cosmosdb\_sql\_container

Manages a SQL Container within a Cosmos DB Account.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const dataAzurermCosmosdbAccountExample =
  new azurerm.dataAzurermCosmosdbAccount.DataAzurermCosmosdbAccount(
    this,
    "example",
    {
      name: "tfex-cosmosdb-account",
      resource_group_name: "tfex-cosmosdb-account-rg",
    }
  );
const azurermCosmosdbSqlDatabaseExample =
  new azurerm.cosmosdbSqlDatabase.CosmosdbSqlDatabase(this, "example_1", {
    account_name: dataAzurermCosmosdbAccountExample.name,
    name: "example-acsd",
    resource_group_name: dataAzurermCosmosdbAccountExample.resourceGroupName,
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermCosmosdbSqlDatabaseExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const azurermCosmosdbSqlContainerExample =
  new azurerm.cosmosdbSqlContainer.CosmosdbSqlContainer(this, "example_2", {
    account_name: dataAzurermCosmosdbAccountExample.name,
    database_name: azurermCosmosdbSqlDatabaseExample.name,
    indexing_policy: [
      {
        excluded_path: [
          {
            path: "/excluded/?",
          },
        ],
        included_path: [
          {
            path: "/*",
          },
          {
            path: "/included/?",
          },
        ],
        indexing_mode: "consistent",
      },
    ],
    name: "example-container",
    partition_key_path: "/definition/id",
    partition_key_version: 1,
    resource_group_name: dataAzurermCosmosdbAccountExample.resourceGroupName,
    throughput: 400,
    unique_key: [
      {
        paths: ["/definition/idlong", "/definition/idshort"],
      },
    ],
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermCosmosdbSqlContainerExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Cosmos DB SQL Container. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `resourceGroupName` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which the Cosmos DB SQL Container is created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `accountName` - (Required) The name of the Cosmos DB Account to create the container within. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `databaseName` - (Required) The name of the Cosmos DB SQL Database to create the container within. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `partitionKeyPath` - (Required) Define a partition key. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `partitionKeyVersion` - (Optional) Define a partition key version. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. Possible values are `1`and `2`. This should be set to `2` in order to use large partition keys.

*   `uniqueKey` - (Optional) One or more `uniqueKey` blocks as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `throughput` - (Optional) The throughput of SQL container (RU/s). Must be set in increments of `100`. The minimum value is `400`. This must be set upon container creation otherwise it cannot be updated without a manual terraform destroy-apply.

*   `autoscaleSettings` - (Optional) An `autoscaleSettings` block as defined below. This must be set upon database creation otherwise it cannot be updated without a manual terraform destroy-apply. Requires `partitionKeyPath` to be set.

\~> **Note:** Switching between autoscale and manual throughput is not supported via Terraform and must be completed via the Azure Portal and refreshed.

*   `indexingPolicy` - (Optional) An `indexingPolicy` block as defined below.

*   `defaultTtl` - (Optional) The default time to live of SQL container. If missing, items are not expired automatically. If present and the value is set to `1`, it is equal to infinity, and items don’t expire by default. If present and the value is set to some number `n` – items will expire `n` seconds after their last modified time.

*   `analyticalStorageTtl` - (Optional) The default time to live of Analytical Storage for this SQL container. If present and the value is set to `1`, it is equal to infinity, and items don’t expire by default. If present and the value is set to some number `n` – items will expire `n` seconds after their last modified time.

*   `conflictResolutionPolicy` - (Optional) A `conflictResolutionPolicy` blocks as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

***

An `autoscaleSettings` block supports the following:

* `maxThroughput` - (Optional) The maximum throughput of the SQL container (RU/s). Must be between `1,000` and `1,000,000`. Must be set in increments of `1,000`. Conflicts with `throughput`.

***

A `uniqueKey` block supports the following:

* `paths` - (Required) A list of paths to use for this unique key. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

***

An `indexingPolicy` block supports the following:

*   `indexingMode` - (Optional) Indicates the indexing mode. Possible values include: `consistent` and `none`. Defaults to `consistent`.

*   `includedPath` - (Optional) One or more `includedPath` blocks as defined below. Either `includedPath` or `excludedPath` must contain the `path` `/*`

*   `excludedPath` - (Optional) One or more `excludedPath` blocks as defined below. Either `includedPath` or `excludedPath` must contain the `path` `/*`

*   `compositeIndex` - (Optional) One or more `compositeIndex` blocks as defined below.

*   `spatialIndex` - (Optional) One or more `spatialIndex` blocks as defined below.

***

A `spatialIndex` block supports the following:

* `path` - (Required) Path for which the indexing behaviour applies to. According to the service design, all spatial types including `lineString`, `multiPolygon`, `point`, and `polygon` will be applied to the path.

***

An `includedPath` block supports the following:

* `path` - (Required) Path for which the indexing behaviour applies to.

***

An `excludedPath` block supports the following:

* `path` - (Required) Path that is excluded from indexing.

***

A `compositeIndex` block supports the following:

* `index` - (Required) One or more `index` blocks as defined below.

***

An `index` block supports the following:

*   `path` - (Required) Path for which the indexing behaviour applies to.

*   `order` - (Required) Order of the index. Possible values are `ascending` or `descending`.

***

A `conflictResolutionPolicy` block supports the following:

*   `mode` - (Required) Indicates the conflict resolution mode. Possible values include: `lastWriterWins`, `custom`.

*   `conflictResolutionPath` - (Optional) The conflict resolution path in the case of `lastWriterWins` mode.

*   `conflictResolutionProcedure` - (Optional) The procedure to resolve conflicts in the case of `custom` mode.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the CosmosDB SQL Container.

***

A `spatialIndex` block exports the following:

* `types` - A set of spatial types of the path.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the CosmosDB SQL Container.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the CosmosDB SQL Container.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the CosmosDB SQL Container.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the CosmosDB SQL Container.

## Import

Cosmos SQL Containers can be imported using the `resourceId`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_cosmosdb_sql_container.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/account1/sqlDatabases/database1/containers/container1
```
