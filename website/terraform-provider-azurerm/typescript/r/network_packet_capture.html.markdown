# azurerm\_network\_packet\_capture

Configures Network Packet Capturing against a Virtual Machine using a Network Watcher.

!> **NOTE:** The `azurermNetworkPacketCapture` resource is deprecated and will be removed in favour of `azurermVirtualMachinePacketCapture` and `azurermVirtualMachineScaleSetPacketCapture` in version 4.0 of the AzureRM Provider.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/

\~> **NOTE:** This Resource requires that [the Network Watcher Virtual Machine Extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-packet-capture-manage-portal#before-you-begin) is installed on the Virtual Machine before capturing can be enabled which can be installed via [the `azurermVirtualMachineExtension` resource](virtual_machine_extension.html).

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `name` - (Required) The name to use for this Network Packet Capture. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `networkWatcherName` - (Required) The name of the Network Watcher. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `resourceGroupName` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which the Network Watcher exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `targetResourceId` - (Required) The ID of the Resource to capture packets from. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

\~> **NOTE:** Currently only Virtual Machines IDs are supported.

*   `maximumBytesPerPacket` - (Optional) The number of bytes captured per packet. The remaining bytes are truncated. Defaults to `0` (Entire Packet Captured). Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `maximumBytesPerSession` - (Optional) Maximum size of the capture in Bytes. Defaults to `1073741824` (1GB). Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `maximumCaptureDuration` - (Optional) The maximum duration of the capture session in seconds. Defaults to `18000` (5 hours). Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `storageLocation` - (Required) A `storageLocation` block as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `filter` - (Optional) One or more `filter` blocks as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

***

A `storageLocation` block contains:

*   `filePath` - (Optional) A valid local path on the targeting VM. Must include the name of the capture file (\*.cap). For Linux virtual machine it must start with `/var/captures`.

*   `storageAccountId` - (Optional) The ID of the storage account to save the packet capture session

\~> **NOTE:** At least one of `filePath` or `storageAccountId` must be specified.

***

A `filter` block contains:

*   `localIpAddress` - (Optional) The local IP Address to be filtered on. Notation: "127.0.0.1" for single address entry. "127.0.0.1-127.0.0.255" for range. "127.0.0.1;127.0.0.5" for multiple entries. Multiple ranges not currently supported. Mixing ranges with multiple entries not currently supported. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `localPort` - (Optional) The local port to be filtered on. Notation: "80" for single port entry."80-85" for range. "80;443;" for multiple entries. Multiple ranges not currently supported. Mixing ranges with multiple entries not currently supported. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `protocol` - (Required) The Protocol to be filtered on. Possible values include `any`, `tcp` and `udp`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `remoteIpAddress` - (Optional) The remote IP Address to be filtered on. Notation: "127.0.0.1" for single address entry. "127.0.0.1-127.0.0.255" for range. "127.0.0.1;127.0.0.5;" for multiple entries. Multiple ranges not currently supported. Mixing ranges with multiple entries not currently supported.. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `remotePort` - (Optional) The remote port to be filtered on. Notation: "80" for single port entry."80-85" for range. "80;443;" for multiple entries. Multiple ranges not currently supported. Mixing ranges with multiple entries not currently supported. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

*   `id` - The Packet Capture ID.

*   `storageLocation` - (Required) A `storageLocation` block as defined below.

***

A `storageLocation` block contains:

* `storagePath` - The URI of the storage path to save the packet capture.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Packet Capture.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Packet Capture.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Packet Capture.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Packet Capture.

## Import

Packet Captures can be imported using the `resourceId`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_network_packet_capture.capture1 /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkWatchers/watcher1/packetCaptures/capture1
```
