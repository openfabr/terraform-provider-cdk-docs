# azurerm\_resource\_policy\_assignment

Manages a Policy Assignment to a Resource.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermPolicyDefinitionExample =
  new azurerm.policyDefinition.PolicyDefinition(this, "example", {
    mode: "All",
    name: "only-deploy-in-westeurope",
    policy_rule:
      ' {\n    "if": {\n      "not": {\n        "field": "location",\n        "equals": "westeurope"\n      }\n    },\n    "then": {\n      "effect": "Deny"\n    }\n  }\n',
    policy_type: "Custom",
  });
const dataAzurermVirtualNetworkExample =
  new azurerm.dataAzurermVirtualNetwork.DataAzurermVirtualNetwork(
    this,
    "example_1",
    {
      name: "production",
      resource_group_name: "networking",
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
dataAzurermVirtualNetworkExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const azurermResourcePolicyAssignmentExample =
  new azurerm.resourcePolicyAssignment.ResourcePolicyAssignment(
    this,
    "example_2",
    {
      name: "example-policy-assignment",
      policy_definition_id: azurermPolicyDefinitionExample.id,
      resource_id: dataAzurermVirtualNetworkExample.id,
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermResourcePolicyAssignmentExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `name` - (Required) The name which should be used for this Policy Assignment. Changing this forces a new Resource Policy Assignment to be created.

*   `policyDefinitionId` - (Required) The ID of the Policy Definition or Policy Definition Set. Changing this forces a new Policy Assignment to be created.

*   `resourceId` - (Required) The ID of the Resource (or Resource Scope) where this should be applied. Changing this forces a new Resource Policy Assignment to be created.

\~> To create a Policy Assignment at a Management Group use the `azurermManagementGroupPolicyAssignment` resource, for a Resource Group use the `azurermResourceGroupPolicyAssignment` and for a Subscription use the `azurermSubscriptionPolicyAssignment` resource.

***

*   `description` - (Optional) A description which should be used for this Policy Assignment.

*   `displayName` - (Optional) The Display Name for this Policy Assignment.

*   `enforce` - (Optional) Specifies if this Policy should be enforced or not? Defaults to `true`.

*   `identity` - (Optional) An `identity` block as defined below.

\-> **Note:** The `location` field must also be specified when `identity` is specified.

*   `location` - (Optional) The Azure Region where the Policy Assignment should exist. Changing this forces a new Policy Assignment to be created.

*   `metadata` - (Optional) A JSON mapping of any Metadata for this Policy.

*   `nonComplianceMessage` - (Optional) One or more `nonComplianceMessage` blocks as defined below.

*   `notScopes` - (Optional) Specifies a list of Resource Scopes (for example a Subscription, or a Resource Group) within this Management Group which are excluded from this Policy.

*   `parameters` - (Optional) A JSON mapping of any Parameters for this Policy.

***

A `identity` block supports the following:

*   `type` - (Required) The Type of Managed Identity which should be added to this Policy Definition. Possible values are `systemAssigned` and `userAssigned`.

*   `identityIds` - (Optional) A list of User Managed Identity IDs which should be assigned to the Policy Definition.

\~> **NOTE:** This is required when `type` is set to `userAssigned`.

***

A `nonComplianceMessage` block supports the following:

*   `content` - (Required) The non-compliance message text. When assigning policy sets (initiatives), unless `policyDefinitionReferenceId` is specified then this message will be the default for all policies.

*   `policyDefinitionReferenceId` - (Optional) When assigning policy sets (initiatives), this is the ID of the policy definition that the non-compliance message applies to.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Resource Policy Assignment.

***

The `identity` block exports the following:

*   `principalId` - The Principal ID of the Policy Assignment for this Resource.

*   `tenantId` - The Tenant ID of the Policy Assignment for this Resource.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Policy Assignment for this Resource.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Policy Assignment for this Resource.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Policy Assignment for this Resource.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Policy Assignment for this Resource.

## Import

Resource Policy Assignments can be imported using the `resourceId`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_resource_policy_assignment.example "{resource}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/assignment1"
```

where `{resource}` is a Resource ID in the form `/subscriptions/0000000000000000000000000000/resourceGroups/group1/providers/microsoftNetwork/virtualNetworks/network1`.
