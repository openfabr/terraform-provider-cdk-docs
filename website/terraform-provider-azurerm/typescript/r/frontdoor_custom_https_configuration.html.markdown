  Manages the Custom Https Configuration for an Azure Front Door (classic) Frontend Endpoint.

# azurerm\_frontdoor\_custom\_https\_configuration

!> **IMPORTANT** This deploys an Azure Front Door (classic) resource which has been deprecated and will receive security updates only. Please migrate your existing Azure Front Door (classic) deployments to the new [Azure Front Door (standard/premium) resources](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/cdn_frontdoor_custom_domain). For your convenience, the service team has exposed a `frontDoorClassic` to `frontDoorStandard/premium` [migration tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/tier-migration) to allow you to migrate your existing `frontDoorClassic` instances to the new `frontDoorStandard/premium` product tiers.

Manages the Custom HTTPS Configuration for an Azure Front Door (classic) Frontend Endpoint.

\-> **NOTE:** Defining custom HTTPS configurations using a separate `azurermFrontdoorCustomHttpsConfiguration` resource allows for parallel creation/update.

!> **BREAKING CHANGE:** In order to address the ordering issue we have changed the design on how to retrieve existing sub resources such as frontend endpoints. Existing design will be deprecated and will result in an incorrect configuration. Please refer to the updated documentation below for more information.

!> **BREAKING CHANGE:** The `resourceGroupName` field has been removed as of the `v2580` provider release. If the `resourceGroupName` field has been defined in your current `azurermFrontdoorCustomHttpsConfiguration` resource configuration file please remove it else you will receive a `anArgumentNamed "resourceGroupName"IsNotExpectedHere` error. If your pre-existing Front Door instance contained inline `customHttpsConfiguration` blocks there are additional steps that will need to be completed to successfully migrate your Front Door onto the `v2580` provider which [can be found in this guide](../guides/2.58.0-frontdoor-upgrade-guide.html).

!> **Be Aware:** Azure is rolling out a breaking change on Friday 9th April 2021 which may cause issues with the CDN/FrontDoor resources. [More information is available in this GitHub issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/issues/11231) - however unfortunately this may necessitate a breaking change to the CDN and Front Door resources, more information will be posted [in the GitHub issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/issues/11231) as the necessary changes are identified.

## Argument Reference

*   `frontendEndpointId` - (Required) The ID of the Front Door Frontend Endpoint which this configuration refers to. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `customHttpsProvisioningEnabled` - (Required) Should the HTTPS protocol be enabled for this custom domain associated with the Front Door?

*   `customHttpsConfiguration` - (Optional) A `customHttpsConfiguration` block as defined above.

***

The `customHttpsConfiguration` block supports the following:

* `certificateSource` - (Optional) Certificate source to encrypted `https` traffic with. Allowed values are `frontDoor` or `azureKeyVault`. Defaults to `frontDoor`.

The following attributes are only valid if `certificateSource` is set to `azureKeyVault`:

*   `azureKeyVaultCertificateVaultId` - (Optional) The ID of the Key Vault containing the SSL certificate.

*   `azureKeyVaultCertificateSecretName` - (Optional) The name of the Key Vault secret representing the full certificate PFX.

*   `azureKeyVaultCertificateSecretVersion` - (Optional) The version of the Key Vault secret representing the full certificate PFX.

\~> **Note:** In order to enable the use of your own custom `httpsCertificate` you must grant `azureFrontDoorService` access to your key vault. For instructions on how to configure your `keyVault` correctly please refer to the [product documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/front-door-custom-domain-https#option-2-use-your-own-certificate).

## Attributes Reference

*   `id` - The ID of the Azure Front Door Custom HTTPS Configuration.

*   `customHttpsConfiguration` - (Optional) A `customHttpsConfiguration` block as defined below.

***

The `customHttpsConfiguration` block exports the following:

* `minimumTlsVersion` - Minimum client TLS version supported.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 6 hours) Used when creating a Custom HTTPS Configuration.
* `update` - (Defaults to 6 hours) Used when updating a Custom HTTPS Configuration.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving a Custom HTTPS Configuration.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 6 hours) Used when deleting a Custom HTTPS Configuration.

## Import

Front Door Custom HTTPS Configurations can be imported using the `resourceId` of the Front Door Custom HTTPS Configuration, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_frontdoor_custom_https_configuration.example_custom_https_1 /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.Network/frontDoors/frontdoor1/customHttpsConfiguration/endpoint1
```
