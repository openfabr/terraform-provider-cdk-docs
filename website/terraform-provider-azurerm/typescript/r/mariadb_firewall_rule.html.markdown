/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
new azurerm.mariadbFirewallRule.MariadbFirewallRule(this, "example", {
  end_ip_address: "40.112.8.12",
  name: "test-rule",
  resource_group_name: "test-rg",
  server_name: "test-server",
  start_ip_address: "40.112.8.12",
});

```

## Example Usage (IP Range)

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
new azurerm.mariadbFirewallRule.MariadbFirewallRule(this, "example", {
  end_ip_address: "40.112.255.255",
  name: "test-rule",
  resource_group_name: "test-rg",
  server_name: "test-server",
  start_ip_address: "40.112.0.0",
});

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the MariaDB Firewall Rule. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `serverName` - (Required) Specifies the name of the MariaDB Server. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `resourceGroupName` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which the MariaDB Server exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `startIpAddress` - (Required) Specifies the Start IP Address associated with this Firewall Rule.

*   `endIpAddress` - (Required) Specifies the End IP Address associated with this Firewall Rule.

\-> **NOTE:** The Azure feature `allowAccessToAzureServices` can be enabled by setting `startIpAddress` and `endIpAddress` to `0000` which ([is documented in the Azure API Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/sql/firewallrules/createorupdate)).

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the MariaDB Firewall Rule.

## Timeouts

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the MariaDB Firewall Rule.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the MariaDB Firewall Rule.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the MariaDB Firewall Rule.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the MariaDB Firewall Rule.
