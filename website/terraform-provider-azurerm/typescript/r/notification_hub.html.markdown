# azurerm\_notification\_hub

Manages a Notification Hub within a Notification Hub Namespace.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    location: "West Europe",
    name: "notificationhub-resources",
  }
);
const azurermNotificationHubNamespaceExample =
  new azurerm.notificationHubNamespace.NotificationHubNamespace(
    this,
    "example_1",
    {
      location: azurermResourceGroupExample.location,
      name: "myappnamespace",
      namespace_type: "NotificationHub",
      resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
      sku_name: "Free",
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermNotificationHubNamespaceExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const azurermNotificationHubExample =
  new azurerm.notificationHub.NotificationHub(this, "example_2", {
    location: azurermResourceGroupExample.location,
    name: "mynotificationhub",
    namespace_name: azurermNotificationHubNamespaceExample.name,
    resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermNotificationHubExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```
