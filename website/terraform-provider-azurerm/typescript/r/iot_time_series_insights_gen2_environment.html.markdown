# azurerm\_time\_series\_insights\_gen2\_environment

Manages an Azure IoT Time Series Insights Gen2 Environment.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    location: "West Europe",
    name: "example-resources",
  }
);
const azurermStorageAccountStorage = new azurerm.storageAccount.StorageAccount(
  this,
  "storage",
  {
    account_replication_type: "LRS",
    account_tier: "Standard",
    location: azurermResourceGroupExample.location,
    name: "example",
    resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
  }
);
const azurermIotTimeSeriesInsightsGen2EnvironmentExample =
  new azurerm.iotTimeSeriesInsightsGen2Environment.IotTimeSeriesInsightsGen2Environment(
    this,
    "example_2",
    {
      id_properties: ["id"],
      location: azurermResourceGroupExample.location,
      name: "example",
      resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
      sku_name: "L1",
      storage: [
        {
          key: azurermStorageAccountStorage.primaryAccessKey,
          name: azurermStorageAccountStorage.name,
        },
      ],
      warm_store_data_retention_time: "P30D",
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermIotTimeSeriesInsightsGen2EnvironmentExample.overrideLogicalId("example");

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Azure IoT Time Series Insights Gen2 Environment. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. Must be globally unique.

*   `resourceGroupName` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to create the Azure IoT Time Series Insights Gen2 Environment. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `skuName` - (Required) Specifies the SKU Name for this IoT Time Series Insights Gen2 Environment. Currently it supports only `l1`. For gen2, capacity cannot be specified. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `warmStoreDataRetentionTime` - (Optional) Specifies the ISO8601 timespan specifying the minimum number of days the environment's events will be available for query.

*   `storage` - (Required) A `storage` block as defined below.

*   `idProperties` - (Required) A list of property ids for the Azure IoT Time Series Insights Gen2 Environment. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

***

A `storage` block supports the following:

*   `name` - (Required) Name of storage account for Azure IoT Time Series Insights Gen2 Environment. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `key` - (Required) Access key of storage account for Azure IoT Time Series Insights Gen2 Environment

## Attributes Reference

*   `id` - The ID of the IoT Time Series Insights Gen2 Environment.

*   `dataAccessFqdn` - The FQDN used to access the environment data.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the IoT Time Series Insights Gen2 Environment.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the IoT Time Series Insights Gen2 Environment.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the IoT Time Series Insights Gen2 Environment.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the IoT Time Series Insights Gen2 Environment.

## Import

Azure IoT Time Series Insights Gen2 Environment can be imported using the `resourceId`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_iot_time_series_insights_gen2_environment.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/example/providers/Microsoft.TimeSeriesInsights/environments/example
