# azurerm\_data\_factory\_integration\_runtime\_self\_hosted

Manages a Data Factory Self-hosted Integration Runtime.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    location: "West Europe",
    name: "example-resources",
  }
);
const azurermDataFactoryExample = new azurerm.dataFactory.DataFactory(
  this,
  "example_1",
  {
    location: azurermResourceGroupExample.location,
    name: "example",
    resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermDataFactoryExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const azurermDataFactoryIntegrationRuntimeSelfHostedExample =
  new azurerm.dataFactoryIntegrationRuntimeSelfHosted.DataFactoryIntegrationRuntimeSelfHosted(
    this,
    "example_2",
    {
      data_factory_id: azurermDataFactoryExample.id,
      name: "example",
    }
  );
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermDataFactoryIntegrationRuntimeSelfHostedExample.overrideLogicalId(
  "example"
);

```

## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `dataFactoryId` - (Required) The Data Factory ID in which to associate the Linked Service with. Changing this forces a new resource.

*   `name` - (Required) The name which should be used for this Data Factory. Changing this forces a new Data Factory Self-hosted Integration Runtime to be created.

***

*   `description` - (Optional) Integration runtime description.

*   `rbacAuthorization` - (Optional) A `rbacAuthorization` block as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

***

A `rbacAuthorization` block supports the following:

* `resourceId` - (Required) The resource identifier of the integration runtime to be shared.

\-> **Please Note**: RBAC Authorization creates a [linked Self-hosted Integration Runtime targeting the Shared Self-hosted Integration Runtime in resource\_id](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/create-shared-self-hosted-integration-runtime-powershell#share-the-self-hosted-integration-runtime-with-another-data-factory). The linked Self-hosted Integration Runtime needs Contributor access granted to the Shared Self-hosted Data Factory. See example [Shared Self-hosted](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/tree/main/examples/data-factory/shared-self-hosted).

For more information on the configuration, please check out the [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/datafactory/integrationruntimes/createorupdate#linkedintegrationruntimerbacauthorization)

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

*   `id` - The ID of the Data Factory.

*   `primaryAuthorizationKey` - The primary integration runtime authentication key.

*   `secondaryAuthorizationKey` - The secondary integration runtime authentication key.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Data Factory.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Data Factory.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Data Factory.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Data Factory.

## Import

Data Factories can be imported using the `resourceId`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_data_factory_integration_runtime_self_hosted.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/example/providers/Microsoft.DataFactory/factories/example/integrationruntimes/example
```
