# azurerm\_private\_endpoint

Manages a Private Endpoint.

Azure Private Endpoint is a network interface that connects you privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link. Private Endpoint uses a private IP address from your VNet, effectively bringing the service into your VNet. The service could be an Azure service such as Azure Storage, SQL, etc. or your own Private Link Service.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example",

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `name` - (Required) Specifies the Name of the Private Endpoint. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `resourceGroupName` - (Required) Specifies the Name of the Resource Group within which the Private Endpoint should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `location` - (Required) The supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `subnetId` - (Required) The ID of the Subnet from which Private IP Addresses will be allocated for this Private Endpoint. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `customNetworkInterfaceName` - (Optional) The custom name of the network interface attached to the private endpoint. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `privateDnsZoneGroup` - (Optional) A `privateDnsZoneGroup` block as defined below.

*   `privateServiceConnection` - (Required) A `privateServiceConnection` block as defined below.

*   `ipConfiguration` - (Optional) One or more `ipConfiguration` blocks as defined below. This allows a static IP address to be set for this Private Endpoint, otherwise an address is dynamically allocated from the Subnet.

*   `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

***

A `privateDnsZoneGroup` block supports the following:

*   `name` - (Required) Specifies the Name of the Private DNS Zone Group.

*   `privateDnsZoneIds` - (Required) Specifies the list of Private DNS Zones to include within the `privateDnsZoneGroup`.

***

A `privateServiceConnection` block supports the following:

*   `name` - (Required) Specifies the Name of the Private Service Connection. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `isManualConnection` - (Required) Does the Private Endpoint require Manual Approval from the remote resource owner? Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

\-> **NOTE:** If you are trying to connect the Private Endpoint to a remote resource without having the correct RBAC permissions on the remote resource set this value to `true`.

*   `privateConnectionResourceId` - (Optional) The ID of the Private Link Enabled Remote Resource which this Private Endpoint should be connected to. One of `privateConnectionResourceId` or `privateConnectionResourceAlias` must be specified. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. For a web app or function app slot, the parent web app should be used in this field instead of a reference to the slot itself.

*   `privateConnectionResourceAlias` - (Optional) The Service Alias of the Private Link Enabled Remote Resource which this Private Endpoint should be connected to. One of `privateConnectionResourceId` or `privateConnectionResourceAlias` must be specified. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `subresourceNames` - (Optional) A list of subresource names which the Private Endpoint is able to connect to. `subresourceNames` corresponds to `groupId`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

\-> Several possible values for this field are shown below, however this is not extensive:

| Resource Type                 | SubResource Name       | Secondary SubResource Name |
|-------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|

| Recovery Services Vault       | AzureSiteRecovery      |                            |

Some resource types (such as Storage Account) only support 1 subresource per private endpoint. See the product [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview#private-link-resource) for more information.

* `requestMessage` - (Optional) A message passed to the owner of the remote resource when the private endpoint attempts to establish the connection to the remote resource. The request message can be a maximum of `140` characters in length. Only valid if `isManualConnection` is set to `true`.

***

An `ipConfiguration` block supports the following:

*   `name` - (Required) Specifies the Name of the IP Configuration. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `privateIpAddress` - (Required) Specifies the static IP address within the private endpoint's subnet to be used. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `subresourceName` - (Optional) Specifies the subresource this IP address applies to. `subresourceNames` corresponds to `groupId`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `memberName` - (Optional) Specifies the member name this IP address applies to. If it is not specified, it will use the value of `subresourceName`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

\-> **NOTE:** `memberName` will be required and will not take the value of `subresourceName` in the next major version.
