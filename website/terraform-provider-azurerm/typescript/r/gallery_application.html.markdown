    location: azurermResourceGroupExample.location,
    name: "example-gallery",
    resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,

/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermSharedImageGalleryExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const azurermGalleryApplicationExample =
  new azurerm.galleryApplication.GalleryApplication(this, "example_2", {
    gallery_id: azurermSharedImageGalleryExample.id,
    location: azurermResourceGroupExample.location,
