import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    location: "West Europe",
    name: "example-rg-compute",
  }
);
const azurermDedicatedHostGroupExample =
  new azurerm.dedicatedHostGroup.DedicatedHostGroup(this, "example_1", {
    location: azurermResourceGroupExample.location,
    name: "example-dedicated-host-group",
    platform_fault_domain_count: 1,
    resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermDedicatedHostGroupExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
