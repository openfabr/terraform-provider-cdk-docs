# azurerm\_backup\_policy\_file\_share

Manages an Azure File Share Backup Policy within a Recovery Services vault.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    location: "West Europe",
    name: "tfex-recovery_vault",
  }
);
const azurermRecoveryServicesVaultExample =
  new azurerm.recoveryServicesVault.RecoveryServicesVault(this, "example_1", {
    location: azurermResourceGroupExample.location,
    name: "tfex-recovery-vault",
    resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
    sku: "Standard",
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermRecoveryServicesVaultExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
new azurerm.backupPolicyFileShare.BackupPolicyFileShare(this, "policy", {
  backup: [
    {
      frequency: "Daily",
      time: "23:00",
    },
  ],
  name: "tfex-recovery-vault-policy",
  recovery_vault_name: azurermRecoveryServicesVaultExample.name,
  resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
  retention_daily: [
    {
      count: 10,
    },
  ],
  retention_monthly: [
    {
      count: 7,
      weekdays: ["Sunday", "Wednesday"],
      weeks: ["First", "Last"],
    },
  ],
  retention_weekly: [
    {
      count: 7,
      weekdays: ["Sunday", "Wednesday", "Friday", "Saturday"],
    },
  ],
  retention_yearly: [
    {
      count: 7,
      months: ["January"],

    },
  ],
  timezone: "UTC",
