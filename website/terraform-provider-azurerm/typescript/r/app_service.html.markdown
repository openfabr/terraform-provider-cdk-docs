# azurerm\_app\_service

Manages an App Service (within an App Service Plan).

!> **NOTE:** This resource has been deprecated in version 3.0 of the AzureRM provider and will be removed in version 4.0. Please use [`azurermLinuxWebApp`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/linux_web_app) and [`azurermWindowsWebApp`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/windows_web_app) resources instead.

\-> **Note:** When using Slots - the `appSettings`, `connectionString` and `siteConfig` blocks on the `azurermAppService` resource will be overwritten when promoting a Slot using the `azurermAppServiceActiveSlot` resource.

## Example Usage

This example provisions a Windows App Service. Other examples of the `azurermAppService` resource can be found in [the `/examples/appService` directory within the GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/tree/main/examples/app-service)

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example",
