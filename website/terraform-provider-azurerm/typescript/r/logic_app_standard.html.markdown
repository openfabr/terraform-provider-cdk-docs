```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Logic App Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `resourceGroupName` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to create the Logic App. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `appServicePlanId` - (Required) The ID of the App Service Plan within which to create this Logic App

*   `appSettings` - (Optional) A map of key-value pairs for [App Settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-app-settings) and custom values.

\~> **NOTE:** There are a number of application settings that will be managed for you by this resource type and *shouldn't* be configured separately as part of the app\_settings you specify.  `azureWebJobsStorage` is filled based on `storageAccountName` and `storageAccountAccessKey`. `websiteContentshare` is detailed below. `functionsExtensionVersion` is filled based on `version`. `appKind` is set to workflowApp and `azureFunctionsJobHostExtensionBundleId` and `azureFunctionsJobHostExtensionBundleVersion` are set as detailed below.

*   `useExtensionBundle` - (Optional) Should the logic app use the bundled extension package? If true, then application settings for `azureFunctionsJobHostExtensionBundleId` and `azureFunctionsJobHostExtensionBundleVersion` will be created. Defaults to `true`.

*   `bundleVersion` - (Optional) If `useExtensionBundle` then controls the allowed range for bundle versions. Default `[1.*,200)`

*   `connectionString` - (Optional) An `connectionString` block as defined below.

*   `clientAffinityEnabled` - (Optional) Should the Logic App send session affinity cookies, which route client requests in the same session to the same instance?

*   `clientCertificateMode` - (Optional) The mode of the Logic App's client certificates requirement for incoming requests. Possible values are `required` and `optional`.

*   `enabled` - (Optional) Is the Logic App enabled? Defaults to `true`.

*   `siteConfig` - (Optional) A `siteConfig` object as defined below.

*   `storageAccountName` - (Required) The backend storage account name which will be used by this Logic App (e.g. for Stateful workflows data). Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `storageAccountAccessKey` - (Required) The access key which will be used to access the backend storage account for the Logic App

*   `storageAccountShareName` - (Optional) The name of the share used by the logic app, if you want to use a custom name. This corresponds to the WEBSITE\_CONTENTSHARE appsetting, which this resource will create for you. If you don't specify a name, then this resource will generate a dynamic name. This setting is useful if you want to provision a storage account and create a share using azurerm\_storage\_share

\~> **Note:** When integrating a `ci/cdPipeline` and expecting to run from a deployed package in `azure` you must seed your `appSettings` as part of terraform code for Logic App to be successfully deployed. `importantDefaultKeyPairs`: (`"websiteRunFromPackage" = ""`, `"functionsWorkerRuntime" = "node"` (or Python, etc), `"websiteNodeDefaultVersion" = "10141"`, `"appinsightsInstrumentationkey" = ""`).

You cannot use both methods simutaneously.

\~> **Note:** Assigning the `virtualNetworkSubnetId` property requires [RBAC permissions on the subnet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-vnet-integration#permissions)
