# azurerm\_private\_dns\_resolver\_dns\_forwarding\_ruleset

Manages a Private DNS Resolver Dns Forwarding Ruleset.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example",

    location: "west europe",

/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/

## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `name` - (Required) Specifies the name which should be used for this Private DNS Resolver Dns Forwarding Ruleset. Changing this forces a new Private DNS Resolver Dns Forwarding Ruleset to be created.

*   `resourceGroupName` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Resource Group where the Private DNS Resolver Dns Forwarding Ruleset should exist. Changing this forces a new Private DNS Resolver Dns Forwarding Ruleset to be created.

*   `privateDnsResolverOutboundEndpointIds` - (Required) The list of IDs of the Private DNS Resolver Outbound Endpoint that is linked to the Private DNS Resolver Dns Forwarding Ruleset.

*   `location` - (Required) Specifies the Azure Region where the Private DNS Resolver Dns Forwarding Ruleset should exist. Changing this forces a new Private DNS Resolver Dns Forwarding Ruleset to be created.

*   `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the Private DNS Resolver Dns Forwarding Ruleset.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Private DNS Resolver Dns Forwarding Ruleset.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Private DNS Resolver Dns Forwarding Ruleset.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Private DNS Resolver Dns Forwarding Ruleset.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Private DNS Resolver Dns Forwarding Ruleset.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Private DNS Resolver Dns Forwarding Ruleset.

## Import

Private DNS Resolver Dns Forwarding Ruleset can be imported using the `resourceId`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_private_dns_resolver_dns_forwarding_ruleset.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/resourceGroup1/providers/Microsoft.Network/dnsForwardingRulesets/dnsForwardingRuleset1
