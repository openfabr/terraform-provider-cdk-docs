## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    location: "West Europe",
    name: "tfex-automation-account",
  }
);
const azurermAutomationAccountExample =
  new azurerm.automationAccount.AutomationAccount(this, "example_1", {
    location: azurermResourceGroupExample.location,
    name: "tfex-automation-account",
    resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
    sku_name: "Basic",
  });
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermAutomationAccountExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const azurermAutomationScheduleExample =
  new azurerm.automationSchedule.AutomationSchedule(this, "example_2", {
    automation_account_name: azurermAutomationAccountExample.name,
    description: "This is an example schedule",
    frequency: "Week",
    interval: 1,
    name: "tfex-automation-schedule",
    resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
    start_time: "2014-04-15T18:00:15+02:00",
    timezone: "Australia/Perth",
    week_days: ["Friday"],

azurermAutomationScheduleExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
