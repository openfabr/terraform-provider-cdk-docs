# azurerm\_cosmosdb\_account

Manages a CosmosDB (formally DocumentDB) Account.

## Example Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";

/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm, random.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

*   `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the CosmosDB Account. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `resourceGroupName` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which the CosmosDB Account is created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

\~> **NOTE:** `createMode` only works when `backupType` is `continuous`.

*   `defaultIdentityType` - (Optional) The default identity for accessing Key Vault. Possible values are `firstPartyIdentity`, `systemAssignedIdentity` or start with `userAssignedIdentity`.

*   `kind` - (Optional) Specifies the Kind of CosmosDB to create - possible values are `globalDocumentDb`, `mongoDb` and `parse`. Defaults to `globalDocumentDb`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

*   `consistencyPolicy` - (Required) Specifies a `consistencyPolicy` resource, used to define the consistency policy for this CosmosDB account.

*   `geoLocation` - (Required) Specifies a `geoLocation` resource, used to define where data should be replicated with the `failoverPriority` 0 specifying the primary location. Value is a `geoLocation` block as defined below.

\~> **NOTE:** To enable the "Allow access from the Azure portal" behavior, you should add the IP addresses provided by the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-configure-firewall#allow-requests-from-the-azure-portal) to this list.

\~> **NOTE:** To enable the "Accept connections from within public Azure datacenters" behavior, you should add `0000` to the list, see the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-configure-firewall#allow-requests-from-global-azure-datacenters-or-other-sources-within-azure) for more details.

The `consistencyPolicy` block Configures the database consistency and supports the following:

*   `consistencyLevel` - (Required) The Consistency Level to use for this CosmosDB Account - can be either `boundedStaleness`, `eventual`, `session`, `strong` or `consistentPrefix`.

*   `maxIntervalInSeconds` - (Optional) When used with the Bounded Staleness consistency level, this value represents the time amount of staleness (in seconds) tolerated. The accepted range for this value is `5` - `86400` (1 day). Defaults to `5`. Required when `consistencyLevel` is set to `boundedStaleness`.

*   `maxStalenessPrefix` - (Optional) When used with the Bounded Staleness consistency level, this value represents the number of stale requests tolerated. The accepted range for this value is `10` â€“ `2147483647`. Defaults to `100`. Required when `consistencyLevel` is set to `boundedStaleness`.

\~> **Note:** `maxIntervalInSeconds` and `maxStalenessPrefix` can only be set to custom values when `consistencyLevel` is set to `boundedStaleness` - otherwise they will return the default values shown above.

The maximum value for a failover priority = (total number of regions - 1). Failover priority values must be unique for each of the regions in which the database account exists. Changing this causes the location to be re-provisioned and cannot be changed for the location with failover priority `0`.

***

A `capabilities` block Configures the capabilities to be enabled for this Cosmos DB account:

Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

\~> **NOTE:** Any database account with `continuous` type (live account or accounts deleted in last 30 days) is a restorable database account and there cannot be Create/Update/Delete operations on the restorable database accounts. They can only be read and retrieved by `azurermCosmosdbRestorableDatabaseAccounts`.
