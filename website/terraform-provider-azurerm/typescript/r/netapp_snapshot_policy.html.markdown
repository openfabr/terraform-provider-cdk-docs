Manages a NetApp Snapshot Policy.

## NetApp Snapshot Policy Usage

```typescript
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
/*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
  this,
  "example",
  {
    location: "East US",
    name: "resource-group-01",
  }
);
const azurermNetappAccountExample = new azurerm.netappAccount.NetappAccount(
  this,
  "example_1",
  {
    location: azurermResourceGroupExample.location,
    name: "netappaccount-01",
    resource_group_name: azurermResourceGroupExample.name,
  }
);
/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
azurermNetappAccountExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
const azurermNetappSnapshotPolicyExample =
  new azurerm.netappSnapshotPolicy.NetappSnapshotPolicy(this, "example_2", {
